Here &apos;s the X-wing death jelly .
This is an icon of our robot , Jason , it &apos;s called .
There &apos;s a whole story being played out here that we &apos;re just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology .
It &apos;s how they find the hydrothermal vents .
Is it sensitive ? Yes .
And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
Of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
And a final really interesting study -- it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
And the world didn &apos;t stop in the 1990s .
But actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity .
So you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ?
But the test of truth is , how do you weigh that priority against other priorities ?
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance .
It &apos;s a big community . It &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
So , three years ago , I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
And I also entered the world championship , and I won there in 2004 .
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .
So what are the applications ?
And , you know , there &apos;s not much -- there wasn &apos;t much I could do , and they kept on doing what they were doing .
Now , it wasn &apos;t as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot .
And this is particularly interesting , because MIT doesn &apos;t have an honor code .
Nobody knew it was an actor .
We can think about how we &apos;re going to test this intuition in our private life , in our business life , and most particularly when it goes to policy , when we think about things like No Child Left Behind , when you create new stock markets , when you create other policies -- taxation , health care and so on .
So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they &apos;re paying by paying for these business tax breaks .
Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out .
Is that something that you are still invested in , that you still believe in the notion of investment ?
So , one of the growing fields that we &apos;re working on at the Media Lab right now is music , mind and health .
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System . It &apos;s a series of books .
What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music ?
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
The writer , Thomas Frank , says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests , that voters , like a lot of us , assume , that if they hear something that sounds like it &apos;s sincere , that it &apos;s coming from the gut , that it &apos;s passionate , that it &apos;s more authentic .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
Well , it won &apos;t . It hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
And the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , Michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
So to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
We did hundreds of necropsies , and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves .
And this changes everything .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what &apos;s authentic in an Airstream trailer , and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
The worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
Kristina Gjerde : Making law on the high seas
In 2009 , when the U.N. reviewed progress , they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected .
It &apos;s protecting five World Heritage sites .
Our species are ocean-basin-wide .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
And for that reason , polio eradication : it &apos;s the ultimate in equity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justice .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you .
I finally got the pictures developed and I &apos;d love to give them to you . &quot;
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because I was struggling with my own secrets .
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family .
He looks out his window ; he calls me upstairs ; he said , &quot; Hey Anthony . &quot;
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
And it &apos;s painful enough now -- and I think it &apos;s designed this way -- it &apos;s painful enough so you want to jump .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
And after the battle , they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot; after action review &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
And it reminded me that we &apos;re operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness , and yet he has different experiences , in many cases a different vocabulary , a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders .
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007 , and an old friend of mine , that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note , just in an envelope , that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said , &quot; I knew if I ever got in a tight spot , that you would come , if alive . &quot;
The very first time , at the age of 29 , that day I am touching the sanitary pad , first ever .
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space .
Indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .
So when we found the cancer , it doesn &apos;t seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other , we believed that , if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough , and we worked hard enough , we could keep him from dying ever .
And Terence died six days later .
Now , I think this maybe isn &apos;t a very useful way of thinking .
He &apos;s won all the fights , he &apos;s eluded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he &apos;s come to the city of Alexandria and realized he &apos;s lost .
African agriculture today is among , or is , the most under-capitalized in the world .
And this leads to very high handling costs .
Well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market , and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done .
It will stop them from doing simple , back-to-back , limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from &#91; surplus regions &#93; to &#91; deficit areas &#93; .
I said , &quot; Amy , Amy , wait . Don &apos;t cry . Don &apos;t cry .
Whatever it is , instead of deleting you , what I want to do is study you .
So every year , instead of just teaching our students , we also have a wellness week .
We &apos;ve found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
So this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes .
And everybody raised their hand .
So maybe the first sheet you would do good work , but then you see nobody is really testing it , so you would do more and more and more .
You had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
Imagine I asked you , &quot; How much would you sell your kids for ? &quot;
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down , but they want to know how to slow down really quickly . So ...
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else .
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine , which tend to tap into sort of slower , gentler , more holistic forms of healing .
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time .
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier , healthier , more productive than I ever have .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways .
In Ethiopia , 70 percent , that &apos;s 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
&quot; Stationarity &quot; is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past , and plan accordingly , and this principle governs much of our engineering , our design of critical infrastructure , city water systems , building codes , even water rights and other legal precedents .
With the library staff and the library board , we settled on two core positions .
The reading room should be able to see the water .
OK , so here , this is the book spiral .
This also is an unusual client .
This is not a high-budget building .
But ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the British public , and certainly the majority of members of Parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .
And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard .
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it .
I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
And you know what happened .
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
And when you &apos;re walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
But I learned two very , very important lessons there on Mt . Everest , and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .
One other thing about it , if you do have one at home , let me tell you one of the features you may not know : when you fall asleep , it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep .
In the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
If you went and looked for images of the Internet , this was all that you found , this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way , this infinite expanse where we don &apos;t seem to be anywhere on it .
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive , as expansive as you can imagine .
We are less connected to it . We let other people worry about it .
It can be anybody &apos;s game .
You are the very happiness , the wholeness that you want to be .
There is no verb for compassion , but you have an adverb for compassion .
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters .
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
And ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that &apos;s how it works .
Say your motorcycle crashes .
Some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so understandable .
I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s there !
He says , &quot; Nice talk . &quot; And I said , &quot; Thank you , what do you do here ? &quot;
The signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse .
Oh yeah .
In my childhood , I played around in my father &apos;s university lab .
Scott Klemmer : So Bush imagined that in the future , you &apos;d wear a camera right in the center of your head .
Of course , we all know as educators that students don &apos;t learn by sitting and passively watching videos .
It was tried only in small classes , but there it showed , for example , that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis .
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom .
And if we could offer that person an education , they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us .
Your sisters would be perfect for this . &quot;
I &apos;ll give you an example .
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery , which is have a checklist .
I know you don &apos;t think that you &apos;re pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough .
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ?
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see , like this .
I &apos;m joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach , Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and — -- and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
You could neglect me .
This software allows interactive use , so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live .
In long-term relationships , we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner . But as Esther Perel argues , good &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; and &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; committed sex draws on two conflicting needs : our need for security and our need for surprise . So how do you sustain desire ? With wit and eloquence , Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence .
And if there is a verb that comes with desire , it is &quot; to want . &quot;
But novelty isn &apos;t about new positions . It isn &apos;t a repertoire of techniques .
Now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine &apos;s .
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that I &apos;ve come to understand erotic couples do .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
A simple volume , the cube .
Through a lot of experimentation , these cylinders eventually evolved into this .
Machines are getting faster , it &apos;s getting less expensive , and there &apos;s some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it &apos;s dwarfed by Everest .
Once you get to Camp Four , you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you &apos;re going to go for the summit or not .
OK . Those climbers were up near the summit , along that summit ridge that you see up there , and I was down here in Camp Three .
While I was taking care of them , we got more news about Rob Hall .
He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings , but couldn &apos;t even blink to indicate that he was alive .
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus .
No , I &apos;m just joking .
What we proposed , and what we &apos;ve now generated support for , is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance .
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones .
And perhaps it &apos;s the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it &apos;s that connection that makes women activists in this particular area .
And the model of 4G is quite simple : Companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what &apos;s happening around in society .
It &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology , and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
Your last job , your dinner reservations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today &apos;s friends , because the Internet also archives , and it warps the past .
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core , because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget , even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable .
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
Our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
Now of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point , is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
And I want to be clear about what I &apos;m saying , because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
And it &apos;s done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
And then the other thing about this project is , we bring intellectual property , we bring a marketing approach , we bring all this stuff , but I think , at the end of the day , what we bring is these values , and these values create a soul for the companies we work with .
So a pretty big endeavor , and we worked on the dispensers .
Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
So then we still had more tutors to use .
And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot;
Today I want to talk about design , but not design as we usually think about it .
And so one of the things we &apos;ve been doing is using genetic enhancement , or genetic manipulation , of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics .
But if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud .
The scientists can make this creature go left , right .
And so , asks The Economist : &quot; The first artificial organism and its consequences . &quot;
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
If you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
So if you will allow me a little creative license , I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient &apos;s problem with a physicist &apos;s solution .
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts , comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI .
Of course we should .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
Whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture .
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 . &quot; ) And you can of course play games .
So , we actually -- I showed that , at a conference , to President Abdul Kalam , at that time , and then he said , &quot; OK , we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that . &quot;
BF : Also three with his left .
There you go .
BF : Incredible , you say ?
May we have it a bit louder ?
DH : You can &apos;t get any better than that . All right . What I will do : I will use my panther-like reflexes .
DH : ... to back .
There &apos;s not enough young , healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us .
It &apos;s not software .
Small animals eat insects .
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this Earth .
With 10 kilograms of input , you can get either one or nine kg. of output .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
And it &apos;s the very same people leading Wall Street firms who , on Sundays , show up and share .
But this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together .
Look at the site that he built : &quot; Star Wars &quot; MashUps , inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .
So I did what the current regime says I must do to be free to use YouTube to talk about fair use .
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
Finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , &quot; The reading sucked . &quot;
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
I mean , they weren &apos;t really jeans , they were more kind of , like , leggings , but , like , I guess they &apos;re actually kind of more like jeggings , like , but I think — &quot; and you &apos;re just like , &quot; Oh my God .
It is unbelievably bad .
Look around the room : chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to lick this problem .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot;
And I was very lucky .
And today , I will use Selam , the earliest child ever discovered , to tell you a story of all of us .
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
How ?
To summarize the significance of this fossil , we can say the following .
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other .
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .
But , this is not the beginning of the 20th century .
It &apos;s my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and &#91; a &#93; T-shirt isn &apos;t really getting to the nub of the issue .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
Late that night , I heard my mother begging my father , &quot; Please do something Ramu . Can &apos;t you intervene ? &quot;
She is on the Taliban &apos;s hit list .
We need peace , and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace .
That &apos;s Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades .
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; we need this .
1998 : A single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , I went to do a job as a research assistant .
She &apos;s 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
Says , &quot; Leymah , my wish is to be educated .
Teen pregnancy , like I said , is epidemic .
So , this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it &apos;s also inaccurate and disrespectful .
But , who cares ? I don &apos;t want an ad in The New Yorker , and most of these workers don &apos;t really want iPhones .
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their gods .
And Xenophon &apos;s book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution .
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic .
It &apos;s a debate that &apos;s still continuing , and it will continue to rumble , because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration .
And in return , we just tried to kill them all the time .
So , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent .
We found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
And many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions .
Now , am I saying that there are dumb people working here ?
This is from a company called Zappos , located outside Las Vegas .
I really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; I &apos;m great , &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then I won &apos;t have any friends .
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember , &quot; Life sucks , despairing hostility , I will do whatever it takes to survive &quot; -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club , folding his arms , sitting down in a chair , and saying , &quot; Wow . My life really sucks .
If you do what we &apos;ve talked about , you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you &apos;re in .
And this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options .
And there &apos;s an orchid that might look to you as if it &apos;s got jaws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the insect to crawl out , getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
And many of the tropical flowers are red , and that &apos;s because butterflies and birds see similarly to us , we think , and can see the color red very well .
Don &apos;t they just pop into your head ?
In essence , they are not different .
It &apos;s a bit mischievous , actually .
Look at this . Doesn &apos;t it look just like wallpaper ?
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV .
Why we cannot be something is not important .
So what should we do now ?
We had the ability to understand what was going on .
And what these guys need , actually , is access to capital .
Just quickly on the results .
So what the governor got was an empty shell .
But let &apos;s take the idea further .
And so what I do is , I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints , and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel , what they think , what &apos;s different in the world today than usual , these sorts of questions .
We see , &quot; I feel like I have been at a computer all day . &quot;
&quot; I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life . &quot;
What are the great stories of today ?
So now , we have a new universe , which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton .
I started thinking about the relationship between communication , media and collective action when I wrote &quot; Smart Mobs , &quot; and I found that when I finished the book , I kept thinking about it .
If they could only agree , if they could only turn a prisoner &apos;s dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game , they could proceed .
Eli Lilly -- in , again , the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems .
Here it is . It is December 15 , 2010 .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
So it works like in a video game .
Are they going to find their skills , their enthusiasm , and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform , or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate ?
They won public opinion over a long period of time .
So the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future .
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda , and we never did .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
And she said , &quot; Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome , you don &apos;t go to those higher levels .
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things , which I also have , in visual migraine , I wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
Very , very simple .
It means that , if you have T.B. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
And what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way , is no longer there .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
Especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that &apos;s superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen .
And for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
It begins in Elliott &apos;s voice , but then Elliott &apos;s voice recedes , and we hear the voices of Elsa , Margot and Simon , characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story , a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10 : 13 p.m .
He &apos;s always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera , but these things just happen in text .
Is this the end of my dance ? &quot;
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance .
And the second question is related , but slightly different .
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus , Carl von Linne , a Swedish botanist , who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet .
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body , and you stretch it end to end , it would reach from here to the moon and back , thousands of times . It &apos;s a lot of information .
Now , that seems so recent . Why didn &apos;t we start to leave earlier ?
The stone tools become much more finely crafted .
It has three core components . Obviously , science is a big part of it .
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning , and I work on new songs .
And that was when I had the idea .
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
Because we &apos;ve got to stop , we &apos;ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
And it &apos;s in the six official languages of the United Nations .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
They have a whole team called &quot; Knowledge and Insight . &quot;
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
But what we &apos;re finding around the world , over and over again , is , if you build a toilet and you leave it there , it doesn &apos;t get used .
This year on August 8th , he felt paralysis and on the 13th , his parents took him to the doctor .
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin .
We &apos;ve mapped them into the audio domain , so they &apos;re singing to you .
But he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; Because it &apos;s there . &quot;
I can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely , I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and I &apos;m unable to do it justice .
Adam Savage talks about his fascination with the dodo bird , and how it led him on a strange and surprising double quest . It &apos;s an entertaining adventure through the mind of a creative obsessive .
I wasn &apos;t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; I just noticed that as I finished this skull , the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be .
So now , I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon .
You want to know how obsessed I am . This project &apos;s only for me , and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper , in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
The project aim is really quite simple .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn &apos;t exist .
&quot; Yeah , well of course , I &apos;m looking after my patient . &quot;
Our research often starts with a very simple question .
And the mobile phone , in addition , is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it &apos;s convenient .
Just from a design perspective , we didn &apos;t really understand how they did it , and so that &apos;s just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing .
They reverse-engineer manuals .
When everyone &apos;s connected .
Then hear this , please .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
I , for one -- and I &apos;m not kidding -- didn &apos;t eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19 .
Except , in reality , the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream .
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life .
So , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight .
So we put his writings , letters , his interviews , correspondences , into a huge database of thousands of pages , and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him .
Now , I should pause and say , what do I mean by puzzle ?
These sorts of designs now go by the word &quot; ambigram . &quot;
The goal is to get the red car out . It &apos;s a sliding block puzzle .
There is only one solution . It &apos;s not that hard .
Here is what we see coming .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
And they &apos;re always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong .
Happy little story , isn &apos;t it ?
This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass . One letter makes an idea .
Give it another try .
Unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities .
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan .
Green roofs are soil and living plants .
So I don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
But basically what I was talking about there we &apos;ve now gotten to work .
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; the West &quot; and &quot; the Developing World . &quot;
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
It can be done .
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
You want a dirty magazine ?
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year , you &apos;d need this much coal .
But we &apos;re just one company , and this is just scratching the surface .
Using animation , projections and her own moving shadow , Miwa Matreyek performs a gorgeous , meditative piece about inner and outer discovery . Take a quiet 10 minutes and dive in . With music from Anna Oxygen , Mirah , Caroline Lufkin and Mileece .
And they learn soon enough , even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
Well , I can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
Bruce Feiler : Agile programming -- for your family
You have constant feedback . You have daily update sessions .
He said , &quot; You can &apos;t underestimate the power of doing this . &quot;
That assumes , as parents , we can anticipate every problem that &apos;s going to arise .
Enlist the children in their own upbringing .
My wife bought a flip chart .
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old , his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick , which he had hidden in a ravine on the family &apos;s estate in Russia .
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox .
And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced .
Really interestingly , too , was the San Francisco Giants .
The highest percentage ever in our nation &apos;s history .
Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling , which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled .
Thank you very much .
Nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind , except for Ada Lovelace , and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream .
Put all these three together , and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace .
But that &apos;s only if you look at the monitor as a page , but not if you look at the monitor as a window .
Thank you for having me .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
I was fortunate in finding things .
Then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness , and they get together , and they conspire .
But there was something left .
&quot; Fix the chicken . &quot;
A friend of mine , a colleague of mine , Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University , is actually looking at atavisms .
Marco Tempest : What I &apos;d like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment .
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines .
First of all , I wanted to give you a good visual first impression .
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures , and so we did this .
For me , it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of .
And now , we have to open it up to find out what &apos;s going to happen next .
Hi everyone . I &apos;m Sirena .
Now , I know why I &apos;m here .
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me .
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much .
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
And so , we &apos;ve known about this for some period of time .
And so , these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community , this cloud , the non-pathogens that live in and on us .
The microbial cloud , it is right in front of us .
Well , as with anything in biology , nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution .
So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &apos;s streaming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
And you &apos;re just wondering , oh , I hope the fish is safe , I hope , I hope it &apos;s going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording .
If it &apos;s helping to unite the world , I think it &apos;s definitely the fish of the future .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
He has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory .
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes , their basic preferences .
But I bet there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don &apos;t think about it very often at all .
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
And the animal &apos;s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving , I went on to BASE jumping .
We &apos;re still working on it and we &apos;re developing the wingsuits to get better performance , to get more knowledge .
And there are about 300 kids in this school , and the school &apos;s been going now for four years , and they &apos;re about to graduate their first class .
And that &apos;s just the way it is . You got that , son ?
And I &apos;m working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need Head Start , we need prenatal care .
But it begins with the gift of a good start .
That &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
I painted myself white one day , stood on a box , put a hat or a can at my feet , and when someone came by and dropped in money , I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact .
A couple months later , I was in Manhattan , and I tweeted for a crash pad , and at midnight , I &apos;m ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side , and it occurs to me I &apos;ve never actually done this alone .
And the media asked , &quot; Amanda , the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And that &apos;s not true . Don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
Der Spiegel , from Germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming .
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me ? &quot;
So , after some work we were able to georeference it , which allows us to put the modern streets on the city , and the buildings , and the open spaces , so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is .
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver .
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities .
So the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around . &quot;
And it &apos;s a very depressing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crowded .
We faced many challenges .
And indeed , it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected .
This is politics , not from top down , but from the bottom up , and sideways , and allowing everybody &apos;s voice to be heard is exactly what we need .
The desert is there , sand dunes , some small field .
And this is what they call Zero B type of water , because it comes from the clouds , pure distilled water .
Whether water level goes up or down , the beauty is there throughout .
Don &apos;t spit , don &apos;t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere , that the world can learn from this ?
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; How long will it take ? &quot;
Mariana Mazzucato : Government -- investor , risk-taker , innovator
These are the very smart , revolutionary bits about the iPhone , and they &apos;re all government-funded .
It &apos;s kind of been taking on that risk . Bring it on .
Instead , many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained .
Well , the short answer is , the Japanese immigrants came over , and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles , and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do , which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan .
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that , whoa , chop suey is actually not known in China .
And even the Brits have their own version .
McDonald &apos;s actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product .
DH : Right now ?
Gas is a similar issue . Gas is also a biological product . And as you think of gas , well , you &apos;re familiar with gas . And here &apos;s a different way of mining coal .
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes .
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin , which represents some 20,000 square miles .
We evolved essentially from an African stock .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them .
Now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don &apos;t usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary .
The design has not changed .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite , and that &apos;s how he found them .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
And by doing that , it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .
We &apos;ve been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device .
And , you know , there &apos;s a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be , you know , situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss .
So this is one .
Then , of course , trying to , you know , work on things where the content is actually important for me .
And he said , on the spot , &quot; Absolutely , yes . &quot;
And a seventh and an eighth .
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing . It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can .
How does that depend on what people are doing ?
That second he declared this child dead .
I &apos;m talking about heart attacks , I &apos;m talking about car accidents , God forbid bomb attacks , shootings , whatever it is , even a woman 3 o &apos;clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her .
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment ?
In fact , there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there &apos;s one optometrist for eight million of the population .
What we &apos;ve done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university .
It can change the way that we communicate with one another , how we explore our data and how we teach our students .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
So they kept on going .
The way the TV-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
Smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company , making them a fortune . It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about , because it &apos;s remarkable .
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
Yet , when we take a step back , and look over the span of history , at what we might call the petroleum interval , it &apos;s a short period in history where we &apos;ve discovered this extraordinary material , and then based a whole way of life around it .
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we &apos;re going to go .
And I think it &apos;s a more useful concept than sustainability , as I said .
Most of our local authorities , when they sit down to plan for the next five , 10 , 15 , 20 years of a community , still start by assuming that there will be more energy , more cars , more housing , more jobs , more growth , and so on .
People do get HIV because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
It &apos;s not that easy !
So , what we &apos;ve got -- some people say , &quot; Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter very much because , actually , treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV . &quot;
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well .
We &apos;re just driving so much more ; we haven &apos;t been able to keep up technologically .
It turns out , all sorts of things .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
And they are public places , but that are managed by private companies .
I think there &apos;s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive , she &apos;s going to infect her child .
Doctors and nurses , frankly , don &apos;t have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand .
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines .
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
Our organization works on three levels .
And I started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way .
And yesterday , I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect , if you like , what they &apos;re throwing away .
As a result , this stuff gets fed to dogs at best , or is incinerated .
Since then , it &apos;s happened again in London , it &apos;s happening internationally , and across the country .
We thought he must be out of his mind .
And he said , &quot; I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did .
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity .
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect , excitement , a broken Internet connection , mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket .
They dressed you up , they lined you up , and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
And it looks kind of fast . That &apos;s a mouse driver , where it &apos;s XY .
I can never get in there .
If you hit G , life &apos;s okay , so I always say , &quot; Hit G , and it &apos;s going to be all right .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
We need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
And they &apos;re out there !
Good morning !
Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; This is your dad , honey . &quot;
However , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it &apos;s so unbelievably shallow .
And so therefore , I said to them , &quot; Well , look , if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons , as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . &quot;
And this is quite interesting .
We experience thunder -- thunder , thunder . Think , think , think .
But yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine .
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions , NASA was forced to end the censorship .
Small changes in Earth &apos;s orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth .
Here at age two and a half years , he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
It also shaped Darwin &apos;s scientific method , as well as that used by his peers .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
That &apos;s not the only thing it can do for you .
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
Things are going wrong here too .
So , nobody would like this .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
People hate it .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
I &apos;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there , but she said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
And we struggled with the image .
And then I do it .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
And I was asked to do a fish , and so I did a snake .
It &apos;s the Minister of Defense with whom we &apos;re working , not the Minister of Education , because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years &apos; worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived .
You don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
We &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; Yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
But nevertheless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
As many of you will know , evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
There is a corruption at the heart of American politics , caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens . That &apos;s the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig . With rapid-fire visuals , he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way , and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond .
Well , as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United , we could say , of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials . We have a general election , but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election .
If we deregulate these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? &quot;
The analytics are easy here .
We lose something dear , something everyone in this room loves and cherishes , if we lose this republic , and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong .
And to the cosmologist , these galaxies are just the atoms , as it were , of the large-scale universe .
We depend on stars to make the atoms we &apos;re made of .
And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I &apos;m privileged to know , Joe Rothblatt .
Within just 50 years -- that &apos;s one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth &apos;s age -- the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise , and ominously fast .
These next cells are nerve cells , and right now , as we see and understand what we &apos;re looking at , our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now . They &apos;re not just static . They &apos;re moving around making new connections , and that &apos;s what happens when we learn .
These are quartz crystals and feldspar , so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar . It &apos;s the erosion of granite rock .
In the deep , dark ocean , many sea creatures make their own light for hunting , mating and self-defense . Bioluminescence expert Edith Widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world . At TED2011 , she brings some of her glowing friends onstage , and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life .
But it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
This looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom examines the future of humankind and asks whether we might alter the fundamental nature of humanity to solve our most intrinsic problems .
Well , let &apos;s first look at the probability -- and this is very , very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years , which is surprising .
Suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these .
These are really great things .
Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are .
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
Stop signs were invented in 1915 , yield signs in 1950 . But that &apos;s all we got .
It was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
We have trained , hired and rewarded people to be cowboys .
He didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
We found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent .
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
And just as he &apos;s writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he &apos;s writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does .
That holds the long strand like this .
You get a high-level description of the computer program , a high-level description of the origami .
Now , this -- using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter &apos;s question .
So , I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .
You have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually .
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought , this book is amazing .
And there he is , with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic , decrepit palace .
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
But that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
It &apos;s very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn &apos;t .
In the 1970s and 1980s , a generous spirit suffused the Internet , whose users were few and far between . But today , the net is ubiquitous , connecting billions of people , machines and essential pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulnerable to cyber-attack or meltdown . Internet pioneer Danny Hillis argues that the Internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a clarion call for us to develop a Plan B : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the Internet crashes .
All of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet , including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations , started getting re-routed through China .
They have an informed opinion , but it &apos;s changing so quickly that even the experts don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
And this isn &apos;t only happening in amusement parks .
How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try ?
It will work the same either way .
The other third didn &apos;t lie , or perhaps forgot , or you &apos;re lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . This fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
Here &apos;s a reviewer online , on Amazon .
Well , we were really interested in it , and so what we did is we brought people , online daters , into the lab , and then we measured them . We got their height up against the wall , we put them on a scale , got their weight -- ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver &apos;s license to get their age .
So we &apos;ve been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record . In fact , even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now , with the printing press , which is very recent in our past , and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II , so even the people of the last two millennia , most of the words they ever said -- poof ! -- disappeared .
Our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it &apos;s not going to be accurate all the time .
At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
Since then , they publish every year .
Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
But actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the Guardian newspaper .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
See , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms .
Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; picture , but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light .
Well , the reason we &apos;re doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities , there isn &apos;t a choice , because we &apos;re going to use waste water , as I suggested , and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are , they &apos;re embedded in the cities .
So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen , which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water , and put back CO2 , which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water .
I set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels , and en route I discovered that what &apos;s really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation .
When I was Poet Laureate , there I go again -- I can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s true -- I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
And even now , as you memorize the order of the planets , something else is slipping away , a state flower perhaps , the address of an uncle , the capital of Paraguay .
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
And it would be self-illuminated , because now the Sun &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light -- so let &apos;s make our little Earth self-illuminated .
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
It &apos;s a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it &apos;s going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
But if we detect those earliest moments , it &apos;ll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
I &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit .
And I remember it really well , because I don &apos;t have a lot of epiphanies .
And we know that from Spain , we know that &quot; sol y sombra . &quot;
We are not using fossil energies .
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion .
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician ; she just had a feeling for math .
That &apos;s kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here , and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel .
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story , but it &apos;s a great story .
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this .
It &apos;s been estimated in the U.S. , in a tiny colony of big brown bats , that they will feed on over a million insects a year , and in the United States of America , right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome .
So this is where we are right now , but what about the future ?
If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on eBay .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
And he could still hold his wife &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do buttons on his clothes , can &apos;t feed himself .
And here is data on 15,000 people &apos;s current anxiety , right now .
So , patients have this . We &apos;re for patients .
I can &apos;t say whether lithium works in all ALS patients , but I can say whether it works in Humberto .
So , remember I told you about my brother &apos;s stem cell transplant .
&quot; The Grey Album &quot; becomes an immediate sensation online , and the Beatles &apos; record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for &quot; unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property . &quot;
2007 . The iPhone makes it debut .
So here &apos;s the sort of equation we &apos;re looking at .
But what &apos;s interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this .
I mean , I can &apos;t save the world . Nobody can .
I mean , these kids , without control , throwing Molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .
So I asked the people what happened .
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project .
They would be really useful . &quot;
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
How was our role in this garden similar and different ?
As an intellectual matter , looking at the world from other species &apos; points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly , which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
And that is this : the farm is called Polyface , which means ...
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass , they shed roots ; they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .
Now there are 500 cities , nearly , with a million people or more in them .
You &apos;ll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .
And we &apos;ve decided in the next three years , we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business .
So let &apos;s take an example , measure the things that are important in your business .
So the Earth is cool , but what we really want to show are the spacecraft , so I &apos;m going to bring the interface back up , and now you &apos;re looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
Yes ?
They extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
By now , you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is .
But that &apos;s not the whole story , because there are signals , electrical signals , that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .
And if we can do that , the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .
Thank you .
Eventually , we &apos;re going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges .
So here we are : a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet .
And by definition , every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul , a global citizen .
They were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
Whether it &apos;s by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets , government itself , or partner with major corporations , there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation .
When we think about solutions to poverty , we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity .
I &apos;ve called this vehicle , generically , a volantor , after the Latin word &quot; volant , &quot; meaning , to fly in a light , nimble manner .
So the issue then , I &apos;ve often asked , is when is it going to happen ?
There &apos;s an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s , when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft .
that &apos;s a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco .
Now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac .
Fifty years later , as a tribute , the International Space Station , which is still up there tonight , synced its orbit with Gagarin &apos;s orbit , at the exact same time of day , and filmed it , so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride , possibly a lonely one , the first person to ever see such a thing .
And she sort of , she had no idea of the context in which she &apos;d landed .
Who knew ?
I have to tell it , because there was no one to put two and two together .
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound .
Now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain , in which , in a very elaborate experiment we &apos;ve reconstructed the responses , location by location , in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons .
The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context .
And the brain specializes for it .
Think of the children on the slow side of the class .
Fiorenzo Omenetto shares 20 + astonishing new uses for silk , one of nature &apos;s most elegant materials -- in transmitting light , improving sustainability , adding strength and making medical leaps and bounds . On stage , he shows a few intriguing items made of the versatile stuff .
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
This was me at age 13 , when I started my first diet .
That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available , and it &apos;s also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity .
Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
They rise or fall , they live or die , as one .
Well , in the last 12 years it &apos;s become much more apparent that it is .
Nowadays , Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning , they do battle for two days , then they fly home Thursday afternoon .
Now let me be clear . I &apos;m not blaming the women here .
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane .
As web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes , there &apos;s a dangerous unintended consequence : We get trapped in a &quot; filter bubble &quot; and don &apos;t get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview . Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
It wasn &apos;t perfect , but it got us through the last century .
So , Buddha &apos;s teaching has lost its momentum .
That &apos;s it . I &apos;m a useless person and there &apos;s no Buddha , no Maitreya , and everything is all hopeless .
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
And so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
And you look at them , and you see how they are .
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it &apos;s all over .
One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different .
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
But could you go a little further ?
Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .
Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president .
So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; ck &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai .
And the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
Now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook .
Here it is .
You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
And he did a painting of this experience , which he called &quot; In the Realm of Music . &quot;
So for example , in the 11th century , people liked pieces that ended like this .
And the chords , it turned out , were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .
The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that &apos;s been sliced , diced , layered and , God knows , distributed and sold .
Six years ago , at the time of her HIV diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time .
Now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
All big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S .
In my remaining four minutes today , I can offer just a few suggestions .
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
So today , I &apos;m collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair , skin and nails -- and I &apos;m feeding these to edible mushrooms .
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
Thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts .
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or &quot; Aesop &apos;s Fables , &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé .
President Johnson did dance with me that night .
As his spirits sagged , his body deteriorated until , I believe , he slowly brought about his own death .
So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end .
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today .
It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
&quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot;
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room .
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value , instead of just being chaos ?
First of all , when you form an institution , you take on a management problem , right ?
What matters is this .
And here &apos;s the photo . Right . Labeled , &quot; Bad Day at Work . &quot;
Number one group on Meetup right now , most chapters in most cities with most members , most active ?
We &apos;re used to support groups being beneficial .
For too long , we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
This is an aspirational graph .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index .
While I was absent from Iran , the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture .
The challenge I have is how to do that .
Here is the green one .
And what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for information generally .
It means that I can take these two identical squares , and I can put them in light and dark surrounds .
Yes ? Raise your hand if you got that . Yes ?
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
So , now , what I want to do : I &apos;m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .
Show us everyone who &apos;s available .
It &apos;s all extremely low overhead .
Think of it as a regulated public utility .
Does that sound improbable to you ?
Ten years ago , when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what I did , they &apos;d move away from me .
I &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely miserable people , and I &apos;ve asked the question , how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ?
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning , then pleasure &apos;s the whipped cream and the cherry .
And they &apos;re great . We can make great little sculptures with these .
We &apos;ve got some videos . You can make them yourselves .
But this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technological revolution .
Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle .
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin , whom I knew very well .
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person , and our -- many young people think she &apos;s still alive .
The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind . &quot;
And there were 20 of them that I had -- that I was responsible for , and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies .
And one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
Because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities , that I put on earlier .
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us , we tend to seek simple answers .
And people are embracing this .
So we have visions like this .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
He &apos;s even here today .
If you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
If there &apos;s one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul , everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives to help him replace those lost colonies .
And so it &apos;s not just honeybees that are in trouble , but we don &apos;t understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community .
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD , or Nature Deficit Disorder , I think this is a great way of doing it .
All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating -- they were all on display there on those streets .
It &apos;s just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze .
So you can do kind of interesting contests .
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago , and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs .
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion , and it &apos;s empathy , and it &apos;s passion itself , and it &apos;s vulnerability , and it &apos;s openness , and it &apos;s intensity , and it &apos;s association , and it &apos;s relationship , and it is intuitive .
And he would actually say , while he was beating me , &quot; Don &apos;t you cry . Don &apos;t you dare cry . &quot;
If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
I was asking girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , &quot; No , I hate it . I can &apos;t stand it .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
Something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ?
And no , I don &apos;t know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things , but obviously I know a coded message when I see one .
This is Barricelli &apos;s universe . This is the universe we live in now .
The essentials were all there -- all the things that make these machines run .
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks , trying to get this thing to work , with all these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time .
&quot; I have now duplicated both results .
They have to have something .
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
But of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ripples hit the -- poor fish , they can &apos;t find any peace and quiet .
That &apos;s what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be -- what &apos;s called depth-first processing -- to focus , not be distracted .
Or the 1963 Jaguar : It &apos;s actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it .
Well , this has emotions if you like , because it signals the waiter that , &quot; Hey , I &apos;m finished . See -- upright . &quot;
And the problem is , we &apos;re still working through , from a societal standpoint , how we allow people to be available .
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that &apos;s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before Adam Smith .
A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker &apos;s ears .
From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families are extremely patient with survey takers .
I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find .
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors .
In fact , Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you .
Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam , a cancer doctor in the 1950s .
DP : &quot; Molly Malone . &quot;
Etc .
AO : A bit like this . DP : Like this . Yes .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves -- and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session -- is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
We have not had an idea .
These were the bad projects .
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar -- with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
All colors run , none of us solid .
Harvest baby teeth .
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites .
The idea that in that room at that moment , everyone , regardless of their age , their gender , their race , their color , their religion , comes together .
I was a little nervous performing without animation , costume -- really -- and make-up .
He gave entertainment , pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most .
And this opens up the ability , which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term , of using human cells to test for drugs .
It &apos;s here now , and in our family , my son has type 1 diabetes , which is still an incurable disease , and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer , but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you , because probably a version of it is your story .
This Peers , Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
And Zipcar provides a very nice , consistent service that works fabulously .
There &apos;s the Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting .
I can hear it two , three , five times .
So one evening , he said , &quot; Look , you are doing all these things , but isn &apos;t it nice , also , to build something within ? &quot;
So that &apos;s the way to proceed . Rejoicing compared to jealousy .
It deals with the state of compassion , unconditional compassion .
And just , I leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than I could ever say .
And eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
We created technology and applications that engaged people &apos;s imaginations , and it was really exciting .
This technology is intra-active .
But they understood something more fundamental -- the sheer joy in discovery , the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it , the richness that we get from seeing , feeling and knowing the lives that we are .
If you want to compare oranges to windshields , what do you do ?
Economic games . So what we do is we go into two areas .
So we &apos;ve started this effort . We &apos;ve made a few hits , a few , I think , embryonic discoveries .
With over 300 entries from around the world , I got it , my own little jewel box .
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
So , think of your own , send them on if you want to -- they &apos;re always welcome .
And other examples : this was Marti Guixe about working on the go , and Hella Jongerius , my favorite , about how to work at home .
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .
Thank you .
Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia .
Not much has happened .
And it &apos;s healthier than the United States .
Growth is faster , and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 .
And I expect to speak in the first session of the 39th TED India .
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors .
It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission , to tell the drone where to go .
Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground , and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night .
But at the same time , we &apos;ve also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones .
Liver cells , nerve cells , pancreatic cells -- we still can &apos;t grow them even today .
We use now some type of technologies , where for solid organs , for example , like the liver , what we do is we take discard livers .
We then are able to actually image those , do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form .
Juan Enriquez : These experiments sometimes work , and it &apos;s very cool when they do .
The sun end was about four inches in diameter , and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end .
TS : I &apos;m just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody &apos;s shoes in the front .
Some of these paintings , when you look at them very close , odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles , elephants .
Jacqueline Novogratz applauds the world &apos;s heightened interest in Africa and poverty , but argues persuasively for a new approach .
It &apos;s thrilling .
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
Only then did she talk about saving your children &apos;s lives .
And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it ...
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized .
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about , because , if it &apos;s us that &apos;s messed up , it &apos;s not actually clear how we go about dealing with it .
Like most of our money , it &apos;s just a piece of metal .
Here &apos;s a monkey-eye-view . Monkeys are shorter , so it &apos;s a little short .
I &apos;m just going to give you 500 bucks .
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans .
The remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same irrational thing that people do .
We &apos;re so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know , I flew over here in an airplane .
This is Libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of Libby .
Based on the other images we have , I &apos;m really happy how it looks today .
I had a care coordination problem .
And I tell you , this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game-changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime .
So , even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this , really , we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot . Thus it &apos;s a biologically inspired robot .
This robot is called CLIMBeR : Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot .
We developed these novel actuators for joints .
I don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about RoboCup .
At night when I go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning , I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around .
So , education is very important .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
You can see from the slide , very very strong .
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar .
They &apos;re great for catching you , up to certain heights .
This is Joe Kittenger himself .
And they &apos;ve made a dummy of him . That &apos;s exactly what it looked like .
Would you just give us a little twirl , please , Costa ?
As you can see here , there &apos;s some direct light on the floor , but they could easily figure out where that comes from .
Those times , there were some early attempts also for light therapy already .
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny , tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it .
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here .
There &apos;s a lot of work to be done after that .
So , we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated .
In a war , two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game .
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships , Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on , in this regard .
I have my file which is called To Do . I have my plans .
In my shop where I studied , or learned , there was a traditional hierarchy of master , journeyman and learned worker , and apprentice , and I worked as the apprentice .
So I will try speed it up a little Moderator : Eva , we have about five minutes .
I know you think of yourself as human beings , but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial .
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
And so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve sort of taken two strategies .
What we &apos;re also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you , in the hopes of making you more healthy , making those conversations better , so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .
And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we &apos;ve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books , using them and teaching from them .
They &apos;re actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they &apos;re also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .
It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student , so that every student can have a book or a course that &apos;s customized to their learning style , their context , their language and the things that excite them .
Not just text , but music , images , video , and there &apos;s actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling , rip , mixing , burning and sharing .
Elvis had two or three manspaces , which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland .
It &apos;s a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s .
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
Unlike a normal frog , which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well , this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs , swallowed them into the stomach where it should be having food , didn &apos;t digest the eggs , and turned its stomach into a uterus .
It &apos;s not a frog . But it &apos;s a long way along the journey to producing , or bringing back , an extinct species .
They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania , and they thought , hang on , this is not going to work .
What could it be ? Why couldn &apos;t it be a Tasmanian devil ?
At any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hut , and tears came into his eyes .
His brothers , Chandrabhan and Phoolchand , were also listed as dead .
These archives in Jerusalem , they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to Palestine , and later Israel , from 1919 to 1965 .
And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains .
Brazil &apos;s northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation &apos;s most violent regions .
So I &apos;m interested in the texture , but I &apos;m more interested in the text and the images that we find within books .
Mohamed Hijri : A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis
It is extremely important , and once again , phosphorus is a key player .
To come back to the oil problem , oil is something we can replace .
What you &apos;re seeing here , in the real world , is a carrot root , and the mushroom with its very fine filaments .
I &apos;m passionate about this topic .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
And my mind started racing , &quot; Puerto Rico ? What do I know about Puerto Rico ? &quot;
He &apos;s the father of us all .
We did our due diligence .
She &apos;s partially blind , her husband can &apos;t work , she &apos;s got seven kids .
So let me just leave you with three things .
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories .
And I &apos;m going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution : one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients .
And so there &apos;s this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .
The really scary things though are the physical , chemical , oceanographic things that are happening .
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the Milken Institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from OPEC .
In the history of America , we &apos;ve never had an energy plan .
It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have .
You cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an MCF .
You &apos;ve made the money you need .
I &apos;ve fracked over 3,000 wells in my life .
Artist iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum and asked many of them : Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are ? Most people , it turns out , consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality , not 100 % gay or straight . Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination : Where do you draw the line ?
I kept up the charade for eight years .
I wave no flags in my own life .
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
We &apos;ve somehow got to get our act together and we &apos;ve got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don &apos;t simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization of problems .
This is just nonsense .
What do we mean by good ?
This is about culture .
I &apos;ve started thinking very differently about my own country since I &apos;ve been thinking about these things .
So one of the things you can do to our icons , just like paper , is crease them and fold them , just like paper . Remember , you know , something for later .
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay .
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table .
Guy Hoffman : Robots with &quot; soul &quot;
Actor : &quot; You want to know something ? Well , you want to know something ?
Which also talks about the same ideas -- We use our bodies to think , we don &apos;t just think with our brains and use our bodies to move .
And in a way , I thought , maybe it &apos;s time -- just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century , from going from the very calculated , planned way of behaving , to a more intuitive , risk-taking , embodied way of behaving .
And when it &apos;s ready to coordinate the final chord with me .
My name is Kate Hartman .
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions .
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice .
Well , who was inspired during that time period ?
In 2004 , there were only two flights : two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station . And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
There were a couple of examples here .
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we &apos;ve done it for a long time . The NACA , before NASA , never developed an airliner and never ran an airline .
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster .
So there &apos;s a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer &apos;s eye .
So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter -- this gravitationally attracting stuff -- is that galaxies , the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large ; it must be embedded in dark matter .
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer , because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe .
Well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm .
Our violins , our cars , our bicycles , our soccer balls , our clothing -- they all become assimilated by this voracious , amazing , dynamic system called the brain .
And we don &apos;t really understand what oil is , until you check out its molecules , And you don &apos;t really understand that until you see this stuff burn .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
But in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile , around 80,000 .
And so this -- you can see that you &apos;re paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .
But then -- OK , when TED started , there was no web so things like &quot; click &quot; didn &apos;t have the same meaning .
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , &quot; It &apos;s really important to have a lot of data . &quot;
Think of the diversity of the web . It &apos;s a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
In fact , I &apos;ll just go into one area -- if you &apos;re looking at Alzheimer &apos;s , for example , drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another .
And we &apos;ve practiced that .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
Certainly not .
So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet , and every time I turned it on , water .
Julian Treasure says our increasingly noisy world is gnawing away at our mental health -- even costing lives . He lays out an 8-step plan to soften this sonic assault and restore our relationship with sound .
These days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler .
If you can &apos;t do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
Not like that .
Now , mycelium is an amazing material , because it &apos;s a self-assembling material .
In this case , we &apos;ve grown a corner block .
It &apos;s really the rule-based , regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity . &quot;
Process innovation is different from product innovation .
Here are my best guesses . Okay ? I &apos;m not saying this is the exact number , it &apos;s my best guess .
It is stopping the tar sands .
We need to be able to talk to you out there , so that you can give the message of what &apos;s happening here . &quot;
It &apos;s hard work every single day .
They can also see vacant property .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
And where in the world would you find such water ?
An extraordinary set of telescopes .
The fabric alone weighs two tons .
This story began four years ago .
And at some point I found out , when a kid like this gets into a fit , the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid , which is difficult , because what you really want to do is go away .
You know , perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you .
And I feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia .
And we didn &apos;t know that Pleurococcus was out there , which is part of the reason why this whole species-mapping project is so important .
Now , the last of these things died in September 1936 .
Why would Cliff be doing that ? He doesn &apos;t have a restaurant .
Changes the nature of medicine . Changes the predictions of medicine .
That &apos;s why nations rise and fall .
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem of , you know , the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world .
And he recorded all of these conversations and tried to figure out where the most important ideas , where they happened .
It &apos;s October of 1957 , and Sputnik has just launched , and we &apos;re in Laurel Maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with Johns Hopkins University .
So they went back , and they thought about it .
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors .
What if every light bulb in the world could also transmit data ? At TEDGlobal , Harald Haas demonstrates , for the first time , a device that could do exactly that . By flickering the light from a single LED , a change too quick for the human eye to detect , he can transmit far more data than a cellular tower -- and do it in a way that &apos;s more efficient , secure and widespread .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
And the technology we have developed -- it &apos;s called SIM OFDM .
And the answer is yes .
In hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
We &apos;ve talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world -- but the world is not composed only of human beings ; there are also other animal beings .
What we find is that over these 40-odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as I say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom .
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa , and what do we see in Africa ?
Shoots seem tiny , but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls .
That &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
It &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
And our team members developed this technology .
But the thing that struck me is , one guy said in exasperation , a very famous neurobiologist , he said , &quot; Look , in my discipline it &apos;s okay to be interested in consciousness , but get tenure first . Get tenure first . &quot;
No . It goes up whenever I damn well want it to .
You cannot get rid of it by showing that it &apos;s an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions .
It creates a reality of money , property , government , marriage , CERN conferences , cocktail parties and summer vacations , and all of those are creations of consciousness .
As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
And this isn &apos;t some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon .
And they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
This was the first time I &apos;d encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity .
So I organized candles on a table , I lit them , and then blew them out , then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles , then assembled the videos into the larger image .
And now you know why I &apos;m fun at parties .
It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid -- in this case blood -- surrounded by a wall of tissue that &apos;s rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen .
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton .
For years I &apos;ve been telling people , stress makes you sick .
That guy made a mistake .
It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships .
Now I wouldn &apos;t necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life , but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress .
And that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing , but having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment .
You know my example of the Eurostar .
Google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people assume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
In response she said , &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot;
And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself , rather than thinking there &apos;s something wrong with the painting , I think there &apos;s something wrong with me .
Which made me go , &quot; Yippee ! &quot;
These paintings took a long time to make .
He is blushing . He &apos;s blushing for his portrait being made !
He glanced at me . &quot; That collar looks to be strangling you . &quot;
I don &apos;t need a husband who wants to be . &quot;
Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people &apos;s walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy .
Instead , she felt more free , more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya .
We &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them .
Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over 66 Qatari women filmmakers to edit , tell their own stories in their own voices .
It &apos;s a video game move from &quot; Star Fox . &quot;
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .
Thank you .
Okay , well .
We get most of these blood vessels when we &apos;re actually still in the womb , And what that means is that as adults , blood vessels don &apos;t normally grow .
And , unfortunately , this late stage of cancer is the one at which it &apos;s most likely to be diagnosed , when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .
So I started asking myself , &quot; Why haven &apos;t we been able to do better ? &quot;
You can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they &apos;re more potent than the actual drugs .
For anyone out here who has cancer , what would you recommend ?
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
You can have culture without exchange .
The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
We didn &apos;t have the technology to transmit .
It was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe .
The documentation of this animal goes back to the Lascaux cave paintings .
Add them all up and the result won &apos;t be perfect .
You get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes falcons .
These have been private meetings so far .
In the ocean , what is the common point between oil , plastic and radioactivity ?
And this is exactly what we &apos;re looking &#91; for &#93; if we want to pull something long and heavy .
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans , but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information , so I made a Kickstarter , which is a crowd-fundraising platform , and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars .
We observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
So Evan , choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .
The technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example , a smart home .
On this xeroxed piece of paper , the crash had not yet happened .
I would be less mindful of time and of death , and , oh , I would not be disabled , would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune .
Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck , and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass .
He was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man .
I &apos;ll tell you what happened .
You want to get the feeling of the room , and &quot; do people like me ? &quot;
And we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
There are industrial applications .
We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria , Nevena Markova , spent about 20 years studying these profiles .
In the core , we have thermonuclear reactions going on , creating chemical elements .
These stars are normal like the Sun . Age , everything was normal .
It &apos;s very tough . It &apos;s very tough .
I think it will come from a spectrum like this .
I stopped walking , and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative .
Because you don &apos;t need the get-to-know-you session at that point .
Get off the bus . Seek out what &apos;s different .
As I became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life , I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now .
And this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations .
By laying fallow , I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love .
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
So those are all natural causes of climate change .
When that ice melts , sea level rises by six meters .
Okay , the second story takes place here in Galapagos .
It &apos;s 11 meters in diameter , and we know that it started growing in the year 1584 .
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so .
And I think that may very well be true , so I &apos;ll close with this .
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ?
And we built up a series of tools like this .
If you &apos;re of a more analytical nature then you might want , actually , to look at this as a color histogram .
This is a system called TAMPER , which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .
JU : I think in five years time when you buy a computer , you &apos;ll get this .
I &apos;m the eldest of three . I was born in 1971 .
And then I was a masseuse . And then I was a landscape gardener .
I had no idea who I was anymore .
And I sat there for quite some time going , &quot; How am I going to get off this rock and go home ?
I didn &apos;t speak Hindi . I &apos;d never been to India . Hadn &apos;t a clue .
And if you truly believe -- and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen .
Nothing . They don &apos;t talk about us . They don &apos;t talk about the coal .
It &apos;s your resource ; it &apos;s not somebody else &apos;s .
You talk about it .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
As an American , how do you feel about this picture ?
You &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being .
I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi : Be a dude before you can become an ascetic .
And I actually untagged myself first , then I picked up the phone . I said , &quot; Mom , you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again . &quot;
You know , if this is so , it occurred to me that maybe , just maybe , the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity .
Now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries .
These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on .
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology ?
So therefore , we get a lot of complaints every single week -- complaints including one we get very often , which is to say the very title , &quot; Infinite Monkey Cage , &quot; celebrates the idea of vivisection .
Who knows , maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon &apos;s knee .
You think , what should I do ?
It &apos;s that broken experience on the Web .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
And if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something &apos;s missing , except you aren &apos;t able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
How had I spent my valuable time ?
And there &apos;s dehydration .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
And this time , I don &apos;t like it , I didn &apos;t want to give into it , but there &apos;s a difference between a non-stop swim and a staged swim .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
Nicholas Negroponte : One Laptop per Child
Now at the time , I think it &apos;s fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were -- let me say , apprehensive .
It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook .
Now , I &apos;m going to pass this around .
It &apos;s kind of the loss leader , and then as soon as it looks interesting , it can &apos;t be afforded , or it can &apos;t be scaled out .
In fact , I &apos;ve developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear .
Now when I was a little older , in my 20s , I realized there are not many women in cartooning .
But I &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers , to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .
And we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
And we &apos;re also doing a movie called &quot; The Kite Runner , &quot; based on the book &quot; The Kite Runner , &quot; also about Afghanistan .
I mean , if you have an idea worth spreading , surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words .
They just had some general comment .
I have all my life wondered what &quot; mind-boggling &quot; meant .
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
And the final letter is O , for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity .
Here we &apos;re going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach , with its nose pointed into the wind .
Yes ! So if it doesn &apos;t feel , it will be drowned , OK ?
As the Trevor Project says , it gets better .
So it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book , &quot; World 3.0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no-border effect benchmark , which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
The answer is probably somewhere between 10 to 15 percent .
Hold the hand like this , palm up .
Which one shall have a good poker hand ?
Next is a term -- I do it quick . I call this stealing .
Now , you can carry this in your wallet , so ...
You see , yeah , perfect .
Excellent . I love that card .
So now , that was the reason , right ?
I like this guy , yeah .
Empathy .
You &apos;re peeking . You just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back .
Yeah ?
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut , who was actually on some of the missions , of Apollo 15 , and he was there to basically double check my science .
So here &apos;s the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
It &apos;s actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys .
Malaria : There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent .
And 2028 , 2030 ? It &apos;s just around the corner .
2030 ? By 2030 , robots , not just serving us Guinness , but drinking it .
However , if you actually talk to people and even question yourself , and you ask yourself , where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
The first Thursday of the month -- just the afternoon -- nobody in the office can talk to each other .
I study ants , and that &apos;s because I like to think about how organizations work .
They go out , they get the food , they dig the nest , and the queen never comes out again .
On one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
So I did experiments where I changed one thing .
It &apos;s not due to the experience of older , wiser ants .
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside .
We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics , which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale .
Manias can be good .
S : I want to change my life !
He goes , &quot; Sir , why don &apos;t you drive ? &quot;
One guy wrote another guy . He said , &quot; I never knew these people laughed . &quot;
And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically .
She &apos;s the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today .
Now , you could do that with mirrors from one angle .
After the movie came out , of course , there was a lot of interest in SETI .
So , the thing that &apos;s wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing , because you &apos;re trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago .
And say , &quot; Yeah , you know , I -- this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep , but that &apos;s really what works for me . &quot;
I really thought they were so beneath me .
BJ : So we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
Each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
&quot; I believe : &quot; it did not mean , &quot; I accept certain creedal articles of faith . &quot;
Now , I &apos;ve lost count of the number of taxi drivers who , when I say to them what I do for a living , inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history . Wrong .
And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons , and he , too , starts to weep . And the sound of their weeping filled the house .
You probably think , well , I don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but I think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
Everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
Because I have to know how people react to things .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
They call him &quot; The Plumber &quot; in Italy , as well as &quot; Maestro , &quot; because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time .
Anybody seen a ballet dancer &apos;s toes when they come out of the points ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Germany .
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are .
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
Thank you .
If the end game is global warming , they &apos;re doing great .
We see in our material flows that car steels don &apos;t become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -- bismuth , antimony , copper and so on .
Well , why don &apos;t we knock that down and write on it ?
So the biological nutrients , the first fabrics -- the water coming out was clean enough to drink .
This is what they would end up with , which is another color photograph .
However , to many who live in the emerging markets , this is an illusion , and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which was signed in 1948 , was unanimously adopted , what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries , and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights .
If you travel to Mogadishu , Mexico City or Mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
At its very best , the Western model speaks for itself .
And then , finally , all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain .
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
Now I &apos;m not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn &apos;t support , but I am going to tell you that , if it matters to you , your legislators need to know that .
Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals .
We &apos;re going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut , and we &apos;re going to make your poo smell like peppermint . &quot;
So , this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system .
You set a couple of boundary conditions , like gravity , the surface tension , density , etc . , and then you press &quot; execute , &quot; and magically , the universe produces you a perfect ball lens .
And if you &apos;ve seen Amy Smith , she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti .
I don &apos;t know what kind of healthcare is delivered there .
And the answer is , of course , yes .
But then there are a series of things : AIDS , hepatitis , malaria , TB , others and simpler ones , such as guidance of treatment .
How does that happen ? How do you make something flow through something ?
Interesting problem .
Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe .
They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders , so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property .
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .
Not just a superficial image of it , though it contains that as well , but an explanatory model , embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure .
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and I think ought to -- make us feel very special . But it should also make us feel vulnerable , because it means that without the specific knowledge that &apos;s needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe , we won &apos;t survive them .
I &apos;d like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience .
So , another way to think about technology , what it means , is to imagine a world without technology .
And even at that time , with the introduction of agriculture , 8,000 , 10,000 years ago we started to see climate change .
And there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater specialization , sentience , ubiquity and most important , evolvability : Those very same things are also present in technology .
Nuclear energy , fission , is really bad idea for bombs .
I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I &apos;m hearing that transmission and not mine .
Hi there .
So sustainability is quite important for us , which should incorporate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
So nature is very clever . It puts all the information into these small building blocks , which we call DNA .
Now trust me , when you &apos;re growing a mustache back in 2003 , and there were 30 of us back then , and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement — — it created a lot of controversy .
Then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
And he goes , &quot; Listen , I know it &apos;s about men &apos;s health , I know it &apos;s about prostate cancer , but this is for breast cancer . &quot;
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
And somebody has to see you and listen to you .
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor , &quot; If we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other .
It absolutely means something more .
So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat .
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that , you know , for all of us , food is a basic need , but , and it is obviously with Mexicans too , but it &apos;s much more than that .
So we talked to kids about that , and we really start to feed kids regional food .
What goes in is what we are .
Chicken nuggets , Tater Tots , chocolate milk with high fructose , canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal .
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .
We really need to change it .
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s what the government allocates for lunch .
I took a speaker , I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
This image , and also this one , were made using whiskey .
And our minds have altered , too .
A fish can &apos;t do anything to a crow . &quot;
They were things like , why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital ?
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior .
If you said , we &apos;ve got two squares followed by a triangle , what follows two circles ?
People are horrible at estimating both of these things , and that &apos;s what I want to talk to you about today .
And economists -- forgive me , for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists , at least among themselves , refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax , because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which , by the way , doesn &apos;t require that you actually go to the store and buy anything .
For example , this is , of course , one of the most delicious tricks in marketing , is to say something used to be higher , and suddenly it seems like a very good deal .
Suddenly , we &apos;re almost longing for him to return .
That &apos;s why they don &apos;t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .
These guys can tell us .
Bill Lyell : Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us , and is there some way that we could counteract that ?
There are no guns going off .
Last question .
And what I mean by that is a lot of room , in my case -- I can &apos;t speak for anybody else -- but in my case , a lot of room for another big ego .
And they were full of all kinds of jargon .
And one day we were walking . We were in France .
But he also deeply believed , he truly believed , that if you couldn &apos;t explain something simply you didn &apos;t understand it .
The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated .
But first , see what a miserable lot we are .
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
In some places , that &apos;s part of it .
There seems to be some truth in John Donne &apos;s &quot; No man is an island . &quot;
Well we &apos;ve shown you that GNP per capita doesn &apos;t make any difference .
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used .
Already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis , it will create a disc of light that we can control .
This solution has been called , by some , &quot; potentially the most important medical advance this century . &quot;
As a result , 25,000 people a year go blind , hundreds of thousands lose limbs , every year , for something that &apos;s solvable .
Well , one possibility -- I think that &apos;s how most people respond to this -- is to say , &quot; That &apos;s just stupid . &quot;
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do : I &apos;m going to put objects on the screen .
And they say , &quot; You know what ? Do I need turbo ? Do I need this heavyweight car ? &quot;
Now , carrying this thing around is complicated .
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms -- interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
And so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
In a sense what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve created a new consumable .
I was running , as Chris said , to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP And then Peres said , &quot; Well won &apos;t you run this project ? &quot;
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 -- sometimes it &apos;s 40 , sometimes it &apos;s 50 .
We &apos;re the only ones who don &apos;t have the price set right .
We have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we &apos;re going to go to zero before the world ends .
That &apos;s great . That &apos;s great .
I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were , you know , very pretty photographs and I was like , I failed at this .
And it was revolting .
As long as there is injustice , someone must make a sacrifice !
George : But there is a teacher that is in charge ?
Comedies , documentaries , shorts .
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on Airbnb since 2008 .
Now , I &apos;ve looked at thousands of these marketplaces , and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients .
And interestingly , what Chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up , so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge .
A three-digit score , your traditional credit history , that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is , will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost , what we can access , and , in many instances , limit what we can do in the world .
We applaud the well-mannered box .
And , of course , expressive spaces are not mute .
So again , the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion , which has reduced architecture into banality .
It &apos;s not something that comes to us from books and theories .
There would be nowhere to turn .
Where people cannot speak , cannot vote , cannot do anything .
I &apos;m a voracious reader , a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer .
And now who in this room doesn &apos;t know a 14 year-old hard at work on her second , third , or fourth movie ?
The &quot; dismal science &quot; truly shines in this optimistic talk , as economist Alex Tabarrok argues free trade and globalization are shaping our once-divided world into a community of idea-sharing more healthy , happy and prosperous than anyone &apos;s predictions .
Now why .
That &apos;s one reason .
From about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 : zero economic growth , nothing .
The world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what I &apos;m talking about .
So I built model airplanes .
I &apos;d designed a lot of chairs , over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines -- all kinds of things .
He came over and looked at it .
And breathability is good .
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game , EVE Online .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s inside them until I open them .
When you get to 13 pies , you &apos;ve got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now . &quot;
It &apos;s associated with reward-seeking behavior .
And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms .
This is a climb called the Dike Route , on Pywjack Dome , up in the Yosemite high country .
&quot; Hey , ma , I got to talk to you . &quot;
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness .
This is her ensemble .
And she &apos;s whistling , and finally I do the kind of birth breathing -- you know , that one ?
Carmen Agra Deedy : All right , then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory , praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along , some guy &apos;s going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him .
This is -- you know , you &apos;d think by now I &apos;m -- and still holding ?
Honey , sit up so they can see you . &quot;
Intrepid soul .
And what came up was a number of pieces of data .
She then told me about our own family tree .
One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
They seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching .
And in any species that acquired it , it would behoove you to hide your best ideas , lest somebody steal them from you .
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
And nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the European Union , whose 27 member countries speak 23 official languages .
And what I mean by that , it &apos;s the behaviors that we &apos;re in denial about , and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness .
And so , this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes .
They &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
Are we safer today ?
By that time , the battle against HIV would already have been lost .
Now , what does this mean ?
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing .
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
I think the future of this planet depends on humans , not technology , and we already have the knowledge -- we &apos;re kind of at the endgame with knowledge .
It generates all of the buoyancy , all of the payload for the craft , and the batteries are down here hanging underneath , exactly like a balloon .
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down .
You see the larger wing area here .
But that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
We think the person likes to do what she &apos;s doing .
It &apos;s you and me .
Yasheng Huang : Does democracy stifle economic growth ?
Country 1 has more telephones , and Country 1 has a longer system of railways .
And it &apos;s very common that we compare India with China .
In China , the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write 1,500 Chinese characters .
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change , but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change .
Thank you very much .
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the &apos; 50s .
You see the transducer , the light blue .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .
It &apos;s a project by The Long Now Foundation , which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand .
And hope actually is at the heart of this .
Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies , but it plays an absolutely vital role .
Keynes called this the &quot; paradox of thrift &quot; -- saving slows down recovery .
We &apos;ve created systems , which systematically privilege , encourage , one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded .
And we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
TJ : I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century , in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere , and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water .
Ten are nature-sent over which you can &apos;t do a thing .
They sent me to prison to lock me up , thinking , &quot; Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to .
One , the numbers you &apos;ll never get to see .
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .
But does it work ?
My colleague , Jason Peat , who runs this program , tells me it &apos;s 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
We can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extracting key concepts from this .
There &apos;s a talk about gratitude .
I show a number of photographs and films , but I also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
So , these are broadsheets , tabloids , debates were being had all about this work , films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work , politicians were getting involved -- all sorts of things -- great headlines .
I &apos;m interested in the perception of the celebrity .
So , Jamie Oliver and school dinners ; Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture ; the whole of the hunting issue , and the royal family refusing to stop hunting ; and the tsunami issues ; and obviously Harry ; Blair &apos;s views on Gordon Brown , which I find very interesting ; Condi and Bush .
And it was at Indiana I got the impression that , you know , the gene was likely to be DNA .
And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling &apos;s going to move on to DNA .
So I changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
So there , that &apos;s what Chris wanted me to do , it was -- so what happened since then ?
And so , I &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
You wouldn &apos;t have expected that a few years back .
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .
I think you need to separate the basics of what you &apos;re trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation .
And think of the outside world .
That &apos;s a view of the world that we don &apos;t usually give people for many , many years after this .
We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before .
It &apos;s what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity , or hand in glove .
But the science that &apos;s coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .
&quot; Babies and young children are like the R &amp; amp ; D division of the human species , &quot; says psychologist Alison Gopnik . Her research explores the sophisticated intelligence-gathering and decision-making that babies are really doing when they play .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate happened about 50 feet from where this was shown .
It &apos;s not enough to create one .
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church .
Sun ? No . Well is there another name for a sunrise ?
A guy named Nobu Naga , the so-called Japanese Columbus .
ED : I &apos;ve been looking forward to sharing that quote with you .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re all in your chairs .
GBM affects about 10,000 people in the U.S. each year .
There &apos;s none of what is called the &quot; chemo head . &quot;
There &apos;s now a new research project underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis .
Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities .
What kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
YR : But you feel great , but you have not the right altitude .
Did you land on the rim , down at the bottom ?
Are these people implying that we don &apos;t understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies ?
The study we published last year called &quot; The Network of Global Corporate Control &quot; was the first extensive analysis of economic networks .
And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership .
I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found .
You know , there is a fear of dying , and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid .
Do you know -- do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going ?
We need to invest in women , because that &apos;s our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future .
If you look at the y-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you &apos;re outdoors .
Today , districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers , but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice .
First , the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes .
If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions , you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions .
Now , two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts .
But we couldn &apos;t make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into orbit , an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini &apos;s investigation of Titan .
But still , there was no sign in our images , or even in the Huygens &apos; images , of any large , open bodies of fluids .
But as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cradled in the arms of Saturn &apos;s rings .
And three hours later , that fire had reduced my home and every last thing in it except for me to ash .
You all know that crazy system , six days in hell , you get the seventh day free .
And I thought back to that wonderful phrase I had learned as a boy from Seneca , in which he says , &quot; That man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more . &quot;
That &apos;s all he does now , and this is something that blogs have made possible .
I &apos;ve been with him since I was 17 years old . We &apos;ve never had a separate bank account .
And today he is a healthy baby , who , if you read his blog -- it &apos;s Snowdeal.org , his father &apos;s blog -- he is taking pictures of him still , because he is still his son and he is , I think , at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital .
So you have these people aging , and now this is them today , or last year , and that &apos;s a powerful thing to have , to be able to track this .
I am , of course , referring to none other than Elvis Presley .
Because we instinctively find , or create , a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba , and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki .
And they had to make a decision .
Oh , man . Um , yes .
And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus , who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects , stars , and planets .
I did some more investigation .
You see the icosahedron again .
Once again , Nicaragua let me down .
They stole our flag ! They stole our flag ! &quot;
Once again , the Cartesian kind of cross-over .
I never told anybody . This is the first thing . This could be history .
Should those be in the new package of goals ?
It &apos;s getting near zero .
In South Africa , they have a phrase called Ubuntu .
At every single refugee camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark , who was nine , and make him a boy soldier .
I was a wimp .
They handcuffed him to a chair , and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail , then left him there to bleed to death .
This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web .
But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was , they created an entire marketing campaign around it .
I think in pictures , I don &apos;t think in language .
I &apos;ve got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it .
You know , it &apos;s going to be variable .
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle .
You know , how to have table manners at granny &apos;s Sunday party .
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies , the thing about the autism , Asperger-y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . Don &apos;t just say , &quot; Design new software . &quot;
When we were talking on the phone , one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms . Tell me about that .
So there it is : 227 billion is what Africa owes .
You see where it starts ? September 2001 , when we had something very real to be scared about .
And when I started designing , I discovered an odd thing about myself .
In fact , it &apos;s so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations &apos; economies inside itself , it &apos;s so vastly rich .
It &apos;s a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space .
So we can have a look .
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
For some people , that was like , &quot; Wow , silent stand .
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights .
And it &apos;s really about identifying what &apos;s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness , and then to allow that natural healing to occur .
And what doesn &apos;t work is fear of dying , and that &apos;s what &apos;s normally used .
but it doesn &apos;t last , which is the problem .
The red is good at the beginning , and a year later -- this is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology -- there &apos;s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend , there &apos;s less red , less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet .
One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group .
You &apos;d put them in the body and you wouldn &apos;t get an adverse response .
So it creates , in essence , an artificial cavity that is right next to both the bone but also this really rich layer of stem cells .
And so some of the things that we &apos;re thinking of , and many other people in the field are thinking of , are actually developing materials for that .
And when I finished my SSC , the eleventh standard , I stood eleventh among 125,000 students .
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
And I titled this more from less for more and more people as Gandhian engineering .
What &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of &#91; unclear &#93; by doing things differently .
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering .
It makes them meet .
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type , each of which shapes its sentence .
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally , but in a quasi-metaphorical way .
For example , communality applies most naturally within family or friends , but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it .
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language , I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick .
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .
And that tuna thinks it &apos;s going to Japan , but it &apos;s staying in place .
And this is my favorite .
It &apos;s a several thousand-pound animal .
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we can &apos;t see .
And out of that , you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about , which is our new kinds of organization , or a better way to put it : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
Big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention , meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge , they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place .
And those organizational models , it turns out , are incredibly powerful , and the people who can understand them will be very , very successful .
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology , or information technology ...
We did things on land , in the air , on water -- vehicles of all different kinds , usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them . I find they &apos;re all the same , whether its land , air or water .
PM : Yeah , the house lights and we &apos;ll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better .
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . This is not a forecast .
And because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up , that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population , with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle .
But at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood .
By 2015 , there will be more people in the United States over the age of 60 than under 15 .
And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities , which seems like a lot of money , but it was spent over about 30 years , so two million dollars a year -- not that much -- and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city .
Now that &apos;s one thing , of course .
So a fundamental shift , and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species .
Thank you .
Now , I &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture .
Nature didn &apos;t need to because , unlike the abalone shell , the survival of a species didn &apos;t depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter .
Why is this important ?
I said , &quot; He passed away a long time ago .
&quot; And in conclusion , win some , lose some . &quot;
Not in the Middle East .
One young woman brought her grandfather .
So , none of these cases are unique .
I really think that the number is conservative .
And if you pull the cords under the knot , you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe .
Now , don &apos;t , please , misunderstand me .
And he said , &quot; I don &apos;t really have any friends . &quot;
And at that point , her two daughters got up and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to go get coffee . &quot;
In those days , I was living in a fool &apos;s paradise .
I tried out various computer voices that were available online , and for several months I had a British accent , which Chaz called Sir Lawrence . &quot;
Roger 2.0 : Oprah , I can &apos;t tell you how great it is to be back on your show .
It was about 1960 .
They give me a way to speak .
Because of the rush of human knowledge , because of the digital revolution , I have a voice , and I do not need to scream .
And those resources are going away .
So , that &apos;s that process there . Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 .
And , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away , there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom &apos;s crown -- an internationally famous company .
Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature .
SE : Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the 34 million people living with HIV according to recent estimates .
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS -- now that &apos;s rocket science .
And so three days later , driving very fast , I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do .
You don &apos;t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wiring changes in the way it functions .
Now , when you ask people , you know , have you failed to achieve something ?
And that sounds really heavy , but in the last five or 10 years , 15 years , how have there been some decisions you &apos;ve made that if you &apos;d made a different decision , your life would be completely different ? How many can think about it ?
Some people think the way to get those needs is destroy the world , some people is to build something , create something , love someone .
If nothing else works for you , get a dog . Don &apos;t get a cat . Get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
The last thing is emotion .
I spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design , and studying design in the public sector .
A terrific use of local materials , but inside you could find some interior compositions .
And as I look at it , I sort of say , you know , the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it , and it &apos;s just my call to say to all of us , public policy won &apos;t change this at all ; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously .
I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys .
Just on the data collection side , just where we are through the Galapagos , we &apos;re finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison , my colleagues on this , developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate , in terms of its sequence and its biology .
Within a short while , I think there &apos;s going to be a new field called &quot; Combinatorial Genomics , &quot; because with these new synthesis capabilities , these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination , we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day .
He &apos;s making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
There &apos;s been a continual relationship between inventions , which are private , and reality , which has been important to me .
And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things , and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces , and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations .
And so now what we &apos;re looking at , as the projects get larger in scale , as they interface with broader problems , that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance .
And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing , but something that &apos;s only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time .
In the 15th century , the decimal point was invented ; architects stopped using fractions , and they had a new model of nature .
So , a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it &apos;s automobiles , architecture , products , etc . , it &apos;s really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .
Basically what we can do , is just cut a graphite mold , put it in an oven , heat it to 1,000 degrees , gently inflate titanium that &apos;s soft , and then explode it at the last minute into this form .
Thanks very much .
You know , I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach .
And you become trapped into this kind of representation .
And you render this with the most non-specific material , which is dust itself .
And it was quite fascinating , because you know the guy -- his name was Joey Grimaldi -- he impersonated the Moorish general -- you know , for the first three minutes he was really that general , and then he went back into plumber , he worked as a plumber , so -- plumber , general , plumber , general -- so for three dollars , I saw two tragedies for the price of one .
But unfortunately , the ocean is opaque , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever , but they did finally come to an end .
And for some reason they didn &apos;t want me to come , or it was hard to find a time and a place , and it took a while , but finally they said , &quot; Okay , you can come .
Many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world &apos;s largest ocean protected and self-sustaining over time .
Glenn Lowry , the head of MoMA , put it best when he said , &quot; We want visitors to actually cease being visitors .
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember .
JB : And so as people make their way out of the museum , reflecting on the experience , reflecting on their own thoughts of it , they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself , because they &apos;ve gone back up to grade , and we actually got involved in the memorial after we &apos;d done the museum for a few years .
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
And the answer , of course , that we keep being given is as follows : we &apos;re told that we went into Afghanistan because of 9 / 11 , and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
It &apos;s also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest .
You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was , firstly , the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement , and then the fact those men went , that the regional situation improved , that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary : the chance to be part of a new thing , a new club , a chance to join something bigger .
The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white .
And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
Dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know .
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
And there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct .
If you cut open Stygimoloch , it is doing the same thing .
And everybody says , &quot; A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can &apos;t possibly be the same animal because one of them &apos;s bigger than the other one . &quot;
And that &apos;s a good number .
It tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble -- and this is the idea of inflation — one large bubble surrounded by something else .
A beard full of bees .
We think , oh , bees , countryside , agriculture , but that &apos;s not what the bees are showing .
I don &apos;t research what &apos;s killing the bees , per se .
I would like to encourage you to open your mind .
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
And we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light .
Now we weren &apos;t actually going to put Archimedes in that beam .
Now I should say at this point that normally when you &apos;re looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you don &apos;t find unique texts .
Why don &apos;t we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet .
We always come up with these fantastic large-scale scupltures that actually we can also inhabit .
Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they &apos;re an idiot . This is a complex subject .
Didn &apos;t they see what they were doing ? How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ?
But I &apos;d like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , I feel like , if in a day , I can see the ocean differently , then I can evoke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
I love to draw the deep sea fish , because they are so ugly , but beautiful in their own way .
And then his sidekick is a sea turtle , as I mentioned before , named Filmore .
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
So you say to yourself , &quot; Well , that &apos;s worth something . &quot;
There will come a time , of course , when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge , which actually began in the 1600s , has to peak and level off , but that &apos;s not going to matter to you .
Of foremost importance is a thorough , well-organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter .
The search is not for the solution of the problem , but for problems themselves worth solving .
However , by comparing data that ties together both density and diversity from what we hear , I &apos;m able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes .
I want to end with a story told by a beaver .
So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
Charles Robertson : Africa &apos;s next boom
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
Very good . I think you &apos;re secretly saying to your head , probably five and a half percent .
Invest .
People are always asking , &quot; Well , who &apos;s in charge of this ? &quot;
So how do we do this ?
Of course , it &apos;s my job to say that , but it &apos;s actually true .
So how &apos;s all this governed ?
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .
It &apos;s a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling &quot; the new machine age . &quot;
There are a set of societal challenges that I &apos;m actually not that worried about , and they &apos;re captured by images like this .
The societal one is a lot more challenging .
David Brooks : The social animal
Alasdair MacIntyre , the famous philosopher , said that , &quot; We have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue , honor , goodness , but we no longer have a system by which to connect them . &quot;
And this leads to oddities .
And so let me list just a couple of the things I think this research points us toward trying to understand .
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically , because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal .
Nor did he tell us , &quot; Trust us . Trust your country .
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers .
Better ones , more of them .
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting , and they make people less likely to do it .
People are inspired by moral heroes .
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .
AIDS was discovered 1981 ; the virus , 1983 .
In spite of PEPFAR , the generous PEPFAR , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .
See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level , and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest .
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matsés .
Top half wonder drugs , bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows .
Obviously , some of this was set off in 1492 .
With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia , the outside world is showing up .
They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes .
It &apos;s incredible that we actually lived through all that .
This was what apparently , as it turns out , was behind all this .
Now this situation , already I -- you know , I don &apos;t really like thinking about this , although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it . So the point is that we &apos;re very , very insecure in terms of developing this material .
This is the size of the &quot; Little Boy &quot; bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima .
if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you .
In conclusion , nuclear war is less likely than before , but by no means out of the question , and it &apos;s not survivable .
And that &apos;s probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astrologers , and tarot card readers and so on .
Whereas -- and it &apos;s true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is , we &apos;ll just call it this -- it &apos;s the beginning of the causal chain for science .
Faces are important for us socially .
Here is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these .
Actually , that &apos;s ridiculous , because when it comes to humor , 75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for .
The bars protect us . That &apos;s sort of fun , right ?
&quot; There is no justice in the world . There is some justice in the world . The world is just . &quot;
Overdrawn . Underdrawn .
So within this context , &quot; Asshead . Please help &quot; is a benign violation .
&quot; I thought I &apos;d never laugh again . Then I saw your jacket . &quot;
That &apos;s why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called &quot; I Don &apos;t Get It : The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test . &quot;
And so has my other incredible collaborator , Mark Cutkosky , at Stanford -- he made much larger hairs than the gecko , but used the same general principles .
We said , &quot; Well , what do tails do ? &quot;
But there it is slowed down .
And it certainly looks like it .
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn &apos;t have to worry about it , this disaster is still unfolding .
This is a popular explanation , and there &apos;s lots of truth to it , because taking big risks , as we all know , pays a lot of money .
In a way , that is the story of the settling of the Americas , the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped .
My point is that this is not oil drilling .
What I &apos;m going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict , and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years .
If we &apos;re talking about national security problems , maybe it &apos;s the Secretary of State , maybe it &apos;s the Secretary of Defense , the Director of National Intelligence , maybe the ambassador to the United Nations , or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem .
And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ?
The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions , under its own domestic political pressures .
And , it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with , without having to manipulate them so much -- which is basically what I do , I manipulate them .
And he goes , &quot; Right , that &apos;s life too . I know that . &quot;
So is that life ? Not as far as I &apos;m concerned .
Can we measure this type of life ?
Now you could ask : well , what about these Avidians ?
Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information , of storing information within physical substrates -- anything : bits , nucleic acids , anything that &apos;s an alphabet -- and make sure that there &apos;s some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information .
And we , therefore , have a problem , because they escape traditional diplomacy .
The International Committee of the Red Cross , the ICRC , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral .
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
This is perhaps a first element of a change .
And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
People are going to be hurt .
&quot; You &apos;ve served so well . &quot;
This big cortex , or whatever , we &apos;re pretty proud of ourselves .
And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
So I &apos;ve started working with a few hundred kids , and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age , to be bathed in bits .
He takes his geological data , he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet called the Goldcorp Challenge .
Now this is different than transparency .
So these 20-somethings created an alternative health care system , where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone &apos;s injured , a car would show up , it would pick them up , take them to a makeshift medical clinic , where you &apos;d get medical treatment , as opposed to being executed .
Starlings , in the area around Edinburgh , in the moors of England , come in something called a murmuration , and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds , and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20-mile radius sort of doing their starling thing .
Indeed , the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa , and these numbers appear in his book &quot; Liber Abaci , &quot; which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today .
Just as we created it .
Birdsong , for example , is a sound which most people find reassuring .
I hope that &apos;s going to change over the next few years .
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport , but she decided she &apos;d go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event , the New York City Marathon .
The last thing that &apos;s remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we &apos;re going to be talking about today , all the things that we &apos;re trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve -- things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression -- all this stuff , the Tarahumara don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
You can take a runner like Ann Trason , or Nikki Kimball , or Jenn Shelton , you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world and it &apos;s a coin toss who &apos;s going to win .
The herd explodes and it gathers back again .
All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day , which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances .
So , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
In the age of globalization , we moved on .
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
Which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists .
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers : Thomas Starzl , who performed the world &apos;s first successful liver transplant in 1967 , and Sir Roy Calne , who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K .
In 1988 , at the University of Minnesota , I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured , our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .
So he designed and went and started a village science program .
Why use triangles ?
Well we make lots and lots of pumps .
If you want to put a colored disk , well all these seven colors coalesce .
I &apos;m going to keep this outside , to blow out . I &apos;m going to suck in air .
It &apos;s a great cricket cap .
I grew up watching Star Trek . I love Star Trek .
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
They do a lot of the similar things .
There are more neuromodulators that alter , that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure , and they &apos;re able to generate a complicated set of patterns .
Jacqueline Novogratz : An escape from poverty
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars , and started borrowing , and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine .
And just as important , we owe it to ourselves .
Now this is a very complicated struggle .
It &apos;s axiomatic that they &apos;re dodgy , and they &apos;re going to want to try and rip you off .
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated .
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole ?
And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes , and that &apos;s just a long , thin pipe of carbon that &apos;s an atom thick and one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair .
And so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer .
And they look something like this .
This , I think , is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics , and that is : We have run out of money .
And it was a world of , as I say , not local power , but now central power .
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple , and I love .
I , as the conductor , have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music , within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine .
One of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
Oh my goodness me , there it was loud and clear , surely .
Then suddenly , as if by magic , bang ! We &apos;re all in there and it &apos;s complete bedlam . You can &apos;t hear anything .
He never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him .
Why has that happened ?
What we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated .
But the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters , we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road .
But she was not the only feminist in the house .
I say , &quot; Samhita Mukhopadhyay , Miriam Perez , Ann Friedman , Jessica Valenti , Vanessa Valenti , and on and on and on and on . &quot;
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc .
He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13 .
This boy is called Sadik .
So the management of Electrolux took our pile , our list of incentives , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &quot; Wow , this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
Well , they &apos;re going to places that have policy , like China .
Because , dear TEDsters , if you are impatient like I am , you know that our economic competitors , our other nations , are in the game and are eating us for lunch .
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did , no matter where they live .
Nature , city . Nothing changes .
So , we &apos;re adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days , and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in .
These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda .
These are refrigerators that require no electricity ; they &apos;re pot within a pot design .
I hope that that turns out to be true .
I &apos;m like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing , awkward silences , and very simple rhyme schemes .
So I know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agreed to get lied to .
But if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
By the time we enter this work world and we &apos;re breadwinners , we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam , fake digital friends , partisan media , ingenious identity thieves , world-class Ponzi schemers , a deception epidemic -- in short , what one author calls a post-truth society .
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
And we &apos;re going to see that in several videos moving forward , but we &apos;re going to start -- for those of you who don &apos;t know him , this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock .
Look , listen , probe , ask some hard questions , get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing , walk into curiosity mode , ask more questions , have a little dignity , treat the person you &apos;re talking to with rapport .
When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
You know , a fine line between madness and genius .
He was an economically rational person .
You are so happy . It &apos;s the conversation a parent wants to hear , because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next .
Unless .
It &apos;s the Styrofoam and chocolate game .
But some of them were not whale meat at all .
We wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
On the left there , Julia Platt , the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove .
Now , if you think I &apos;m exaggerating at all in this , all you have to do is substitute something else , like &quot; Indonesian . &quot;
This one generates no imagery at all . &quot;
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective , where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective , but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally .
And at times , when we were like this , so much &quot; Shhh , &quot; so much &quot; Shhh &quot; going on in the house that I imagined us to be like the German crew of a U-boat creeping along the edge of the ocean whilst up above , on the surface , HMS Bageye patrolled ready to drop death charges at the first sound of any disturbance .
When our father did speak to us , it was from the pulpit of his mind .
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety , so much so that years later , when I was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia , six times more than they ought to be , I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say , &quot; Black people are schooled in paranoia . &quot;
She took a pair of scissors and cut him out of every photograph , and for years , I told myself the truth of this photograph was that you are alone , you are unsupported .
The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits , and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church .
CO : The point is , if there &apos;s a flood or a fire or a hurricane , you , or somebody like you , are going to step up and start organizing things .
If we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together , we can create new standards in disaster recovery .
Now , remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old .
I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious .
My father did this . Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey , which I &apos;m glad to say was very often , he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground , and he would talk to , he would say to Akroma-Ampim , the founder of our line , or Yao Antony , my great uncle , he would talk to them , offer them a little bit of this .
So let me start by talking about crack cocaine , and how it transformed the gang .
And for the people who were there running the gang , it was a great way , seemingly , to make a lot of money .
So Sudhir went home . Took a shower , took a nap .
Extremely dangerous work .
It turns out , the death rates on death row -- from all causes , including execution -- two percent a year .
It wasn &apos;t his money , until he spent it . And then essentially he was in debt to the gang , and was sort of an indentured servant for a while .
If you start taking losses , they see you as weak and shit . &quot;
But I have a different theory about that , that model of attention .
Hi , sir , how are you ?
Now , let &apos;s try that again .
Step over this way for me .
And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says , &quot; Untie me . Untie me .
And the future self is not even around .
You &apos;re putting yourself , you &apos;re binding yourself , and you &apos;re weaseling your way out of it , and then you &apos;re beating yourself up afterwards .
They &apos;re making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
We &apos;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
But the difference is that , back then , it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires , whereas this time , it &apos;s not about passion , and it &apos;s not about any kind of movement .
You &apos;ll see the women in red , and you &apos;ll see the men in blue .
They &apos;re used to thinking of themselves as providers , and they can &apos;t seem to build the social networks that allow them to get through college .
&quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
And we &apos;re always below the glass ceiling , the women .
And that &apos;s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults .
But before we start , I need just to put these on .
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree ?
Anybody use my examples ? The sun and the football ?
And we &apos;ve certainly learnt that over time , you get much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
And we think that &apos;s pretty important .
So anyhow , he went there with his video camera , and it &apos;s kind of interesting to see what he brought back .
I think they &apos;re two quite different modes : divergence and convergence .
Eight years later , when he was a young man of 18 , Benki left the forest for the first time .
He said , &quot; Change ?
He &apos;s a Leaders &apos; Quest fellow , and that helps him with his work .
But they have qualities we &apos;d all recognize .
And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself bumping up against .
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers .
Now , faced with opportunities like that , does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves , lynx , bears , beavers , bison , boar , moose , and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe ?
Is it something that we survive ?
The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part after World War II , around the time that picture was taken .
So I could show you mine . It &apos;s just A &apos;s , T &apos;s , C &apos;s and G &apos;s .
And open doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no money .
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol , and they put it on the ground .
I need a hundred billion . &quot; So I &apos;m like that .
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us . She scared us with the lava man .
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you .
Take a look at these .
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme .
That &apos;s how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .
And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don &apos;t control .
So what makes people notice ?
A couple years ago , I was in South Africa on safari .
And those two things made the risk more than it was .
But 80 years , we &apos;re just not good at .
1982 -- I don &apos;t know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States .
For me , the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy .
With new data from the Keck telescopes , Andrea Ghez shows how state-of-the-art adaptive optics are helping astronomers understand our universe &apos;s most mysterious objects : black holes . She shares evidence that a supermassive black hole may be lurking at the center of the Milky Way .
So , now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is .
But it &apos;s a kind of indirect argument .
So , I &apos;ve spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere , to give us a cleaner view .
And , in fact , it &apos;s the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy , but any in our universe .
And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy .
They have evolved over millennia .
You can &apos;t own your children .
But it was a very clever move .
And he gave me a paper that he had written on this .
Same idea ! Well , not quite .
Just enough repetition .
And you can &apos;t tell .
I &apos;ve got one more problem , then I &apos;m through .
Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer .
And they developed this new technique , called Shape Deposition Manufacturing .
I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA , and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice , and life , ultimately , on Mars . And he said -- especially with legged-robots , because they &apos;re way too complicated .
What does the animal do ? The animal has weird toes .
My name is Ryan Lobo , and I &apos;ve been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years .
He begs for forgiveness , and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered .
These men were terrified , as the mob attacked our vehicle .
To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler .
For this reason , I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family .
The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete .
I came to speak to you like that .
I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important factor for success .
And let me show you what happened .
So I grew up in a family of women .
We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments , industry , educational institutions , a myriad of other companies and , frankly , even competitors .
In other parts of the world , you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet , and look at numbers and say , yes , that &apos;s a good business .
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
What the essence of that is , is that we &apos;re taking the sand at our feet , the inert silicon at our feet , and we &apos;re breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself , and may even surpass it .
I mean Ritalin , Viagra , things of that sort , Prozac .
But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world , which is going to be the case with these technologies , when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial , which is already the case , and when they &apos;re almost impossible to police , it &apos;s not a question of if this is going to happen , it &apos;s when and where and how it &apos;s going to happen .
So we shouldn &apos;t dismiss this because it &apos;s an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results , or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health .
And yet notwithstanding , they go out and they meet it . &quot;
Arousal addiction , you want different .
If the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
I &apos;ve seen him lose his intellect , his sense of humor , his language skills , but I &apos;ve also seen this : He loves me , he loves my sons , he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers .
And this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots .
The very idea , all these collective nouns that we have been taught about -- nation , class , family .
This is probably true .
To put it mildly , I didn &apos;t do very well .
Answer : It took them , on average , three and a half minutes longer .
That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility .
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .
Let me give you some examples .
Do it for fun . No one gets paid a cent , or a Euro or a Yen .
So if you &apos;re going to talk about jobs , then you have to talk about entrepreneurs .
And if you see the word &quot; entrepreneur , &quot; most people think men .
So you see , this is not about doing good , this is about global growth and global employment .
Right now , America is in an unremitting state of trauma .
And I &apos;m going to share my music with you , but I hope that I &apos;m going to do so in a way that tells a story , tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention , and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline , and how boredom also , in a sense , pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional , narrow definition of a composer .
I should concede also that I &apos;m the world &apos;s worst Mouseketeer player , and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide .
Let &apos;s watch just another clip .
Anybody who creates knows there &apos;s that point where it hasn &apos;t quite become the phoenix or the burnt char .
The circle of life . The circle of Mufasa &apos;s mask .
HM : They are both in either &apos;s powers .
Manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either .
And you just stay going forward , and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes .
Why would you want to do that ? &quot;
Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we &apos;ve become our own school .
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants .
You can &apos;t speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu , and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier .
We heard that now from the east again the war started , and it &apos;s going fast .
One day , we went to meet the Chief Commander .
And that is -- I think it &apos;s difficult for me .
Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa .
And there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
And as the subtitle suggests , I looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty , and I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty .
And in my book , I went into that question as well .
They were asking for democracy ; they were asking for freedom .
But the corollary of that is that , if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material , all human populations share the same raw human genius , the same intellectual acuity .
They said , at one point , you know , we don &apos;t really believe you went to the moon , but you did .
These , of course , are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization .
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest .
They are unique answers to that fundamental question : what does it mean to be human and alive ?
So here &apos;s the iPad .
And then if you have something you like , you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life , run the program in real life .
We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school , sent to college , and get them prepared for better living , a high value job . &quot;
There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school ; they &apos;d much rather put them to work .
Before that I feel like I wasn &apos;t like this .
I like eating . I like playing . &quot;
There &apos;s no magic ; it &apos;s practice , practice , practice .
And yet it &apos;s here .
So to a first approximation , we have these things -- twenty petahertz synapse firings .
And so every thing will be part of the Web .
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages , so one page links to another page .
And so there &apos;s actually a fourth thing that we have not get to , that we won &apos;t see in the next 10 years , or 5,000 days , but I think that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to . And as the Internet of things -- where I &apos;m linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane -- that that physical thing becomes part of the Web .
And I don &apos;t know what else to call it , than the One .
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
It &apos;s a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around , since we only ever get to experience one possibility .
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses .
For example , this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .
However , if we work in eight-dimensional charge space , then we can assign unique new charges to each particle .
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8 ?
And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we &apos;re all learning about the world even before we enter it .
They &apos;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture &apos;s cuisine even before birth .
But that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
I &apos;m going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that &apos;s going to tell you a little bit about how we open user-generated content up for business .
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content , and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge .
I &apos;m not talking about nor justifying people taking other people &apos;s content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner .
We have to recognize they &apos;re different from us . This is us , right ?
By definition , two people picked at random can &apos;t have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex .
And you never know when you &apos;re going to come across one of these booby traps .
A famous quotation can be found -- if you look on the web , you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses -- &quot; In or about December 1910 , human nature changed . &quot;
You might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
I love the place .
So we stopped the ship , as you do .
And my close friend David , he saw the way I was thinking , and he came up to me and he said , &quot; Lewis , I &apos;ve known you since you were 18 years old .
You did it ! You did it man !
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot;
We built the hardware and the software .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
If you compare NASA &apos;s annual budget to explore the heavens , that one-year budget would fund NOAA &apos;s budget to explore the oceans for 1,600 years .
Why ? OK . Now , I began my explorations the hard way .
In plate tectonic theory , we knew that if you had plates collide , it made sense : they would crush into one another , you would thicken the crust , you &apos;d uplift it .
On a 42,000 mile mountain range . Great job security , but not the way to go .
This one sank carrying a prefabricated , Home Depot Roman temple .
She &apos;s talking to the pilot . She &apos;s 5,000 miles away , but she &apos;s assumed command .
I hadn &apos;t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I &apos;m thinking ? &quot;
So on this first day I actually listened .
They &apos;re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they &apos;ll give you the grade . &quot;
And on Earth Day , 1990 -- the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that &apos;s when I began to speak .
I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It &apos;s in the back of my pack .
Arthur Benjamin : Teach statistics before calculus !
He is an outstanding person , because he &apos;s a small entrepreneur .
It also affords us cheap fabrication , which is fantastic , so it means that you can do a lot more with it .
So we made this box , and we tested it again and again and again , and we &apos;re going through multiple iterations to do these things .
Luckily , not today . And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber , it basically meant you had to have , sort of , more continuous care from the health care worker .
Well , I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously .
The only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve .
But the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you &apos;re talking about .
Which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave , and whether it matches our physical universe .
Aditi Shankardass : A second opinion on developmental disorders
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
So here is the building ; it looks rather unassuming , really .
Twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
And we put down those little floor tiles , and then I went onto eBay and bought 150 pounds of Lego -- which is insane .
And I don &apos;t mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine ; I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego .
But that &apos;s only half of real equality , and I now think we &apos;re never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
And what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
Indeed , there are male college students now who are starting to say , &quot; I want to be a stay-at-home dad . &quot;
I &apos;m not a scientist . I could have been , perhaps , but I work in this world where I trust my instincts .
It &apos;s a millefiori of ideas .
Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
Coral , all these natural forces , take away what they don &apos;t need and they deliver maximum beauty .
That is an image of a car for me .
Most people go and buy the Aston Martin . I built this .
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations , but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations .
In fact , the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .
Okay . Left to right ?
So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found , and it turns out that they were found very , very far away from the Indus Valley .
And that could be translated into &quot; mey meen , &quot; which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn .
It was frightening , and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell .
But that &apos;s , I think , what this is all about , is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .
BJ : And on this first hunt , we truly were excited .
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same , and so in a stroke , the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers .
I thought , the yo-yo is something for me to be good at , for the first time in my life .
So I put it through a G.C. , a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office , and it &apos;s about 400 .
Working for a fragrance company .
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment , and they wouldn &apos;t have liked it at my college .
It &apos;s the molecule that has made men &apos;s fragrances smell the way they do since 1881 , to be exact .
One nice problem is , what do we do about health ?
And you get to think about yourself and your memories , and before you go back into suspension , you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .
And when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
I built this in my garage .
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt , so for five years , six years , I only had to pay one third income tax .
I have no idea of what comes next , so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future , as a little warning .
How old were you when you invented that ?
And they can be treated very easily ; there are actually ways of getting rid of them , there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures .
And the particular display was built about six years ago , and when we moved from one room to another room , a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed .
Nicholas Negroponte : Now , this is his table of contents .
But here , with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return . &quot;
And I &apos;ll show you one more slide , where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen .
And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon -- there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
Do you need , for instance , to be as smart as you are ?
That is , out of the desire to save itself , each creature is following these rules , and that leads to something that &apos;s safe for all of them .
And for a long time , even after it was documented , it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion .
How can metronomes communicate ?
Interviewer : Oh , did you ? Yeah . It felt odd .
Interviewer : Right . So if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ?
I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency , the more clearly we might see that we don &apos;t know all that we thought we did .
And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives , but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence ?
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks .
So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas , but in a more natural setting .
Okay , so here &apos;s a second toy in the water .

And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top .
Voice Over : The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop .
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this .
But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
Thank you .
You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel .
And , very happily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
Here , let me introduce you to Sam Haber .
It &apos;s right here .
You &apos;re part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history , a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter , wiser , more beautiful place .
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book , &quot; On the Origin of Species , &quot; published 150 years ago .
UVB turns out to be incredibly important .
So what ? We &apos;ve been on the move .
You can touch it .
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah , which you may have seen on stage yesterday .
Then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah -- a little homage to my life as an athlete .
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel , that old radio man ?
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them , and Huck says , &apos; Ooh , oh my God , ooh , ooh -- that woman , that woman never did anybody any harm .
And so he put her in the bathtub , and I was in the bedroom with the baby .
It was captured on videotape -- technology -- and it was played all over the world .
That &apos;s why I understand ; that &apos;s why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict .
Well , you know , I guess that &apos;d have to be the rodeo too .
See again , the diversity .
I can tap into thousands of people &apos;s minds . &quot;
And I like that .
After previewing it and confirming it &apos;s what you submitted , you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context .
Collaborator Two : It really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
Thanks a lot .
So let &apos;s abandon the paradigm of let &apos;s search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we &apos;ll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product .
So to produce current , magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion , which then migrates across the electrolyte , accepts two electrons from the antimony , and then mixes with it to form an alloy .
It &apos;s going to be 36 inches in diameter .
We &apos;d like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi , in order to have the perfect drink . &quot; Right ?
And this was even more important . In fact , Campbell &apos;s Soup is where Howard made his reputation .
That &apos;s Howard &apos;s doing . That is Howard &apos;s gift to the American people .
It &apos;s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now , and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy .
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10 , 15 years ?
In some parts of the country , 60 percent of kids drop out of high school .
Children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
They should be diagnostic . They should help .
And they all looked a bit bemused , and said , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have one .
I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of -- they &apos;re called alternative education programs .
Thank you very much .
You can imagine that , for the entire country of Zambia , answering just that single question looks something like this .
What do you know ? Digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper .
Of course , all of these things are cloud-based and don &apos;t require any training .
What &apos;s changed now is , instead of having a program in which we &apos;re scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us , we &apos;ve made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us .
But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the eradication of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
I &apos;ve got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there &apos;s the risk that it might display their balance on the screen .
So the first thing I &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
KB : Thanks for letting me show these .
What will this future without secrets look like ?
To another group of subjects , we told them , &quot; Students and faculty will see your answers . &quot;
Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort .
Many were touched by my personal story , and they shared their stories in return .
After 10 years in Lebanon , from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races , we &apos;ve seen that people want to run for a better future .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
In India , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference .
You know , childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event .
Well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , &quot; I think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
Look : U.S. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid .

So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would , and say , &quot; How can we do better ? &quot;
Sam Burns : Well , progeria limits me in some ways .
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine , Bart Hess -- he doesn &apos;t normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models .
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in , in some cases , who don &apos;t want me and people like me to even exist .
So someone who says they hate immigrants , I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they &apos;ve always known .
And I want to share a couple stories with you today .
That the essence of what you &apos;re doing is you need ever-cheaper labor , and ever-faster machines .
That people on the fringes can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
The Beatles did not invent teenagers .
Because if you &apos;re not upsetting anyone , you &apos;re not changing the status quo .
They commit to the people who are there .
At the peak of activity earlier this year , the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another 365 years deeper into the past .
The 109th Air National Guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of Antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to California , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver , Colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in Europe .
And that &apos;s a belief that I share .
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
Now shared car services are also springing up around the world , and these efforts , I think , are great .
We don &apos;t want to regress and lose that freedom .
And for me it &apos;s just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she &apos;ll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on .
Green School sits in south-central Bali , and it &apos;s on 20 acres of rolling garden .
The food is incredible .
It has administrators in it and many , many other things .
In Sri Lanka , if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka , during the northeast monsoon season , you can see blue whales very , very easily .
They are very good fliers , but they don &apos;t go too far .
But I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues .
So , I was quite pleased with myself . I thought wow , I &apos;ve tracked this one , I know how they come here . Then I scratched my head a bit , and that &apos;s okay , I know how they come here , but why do they come here ?
When those guys , they &apos;ll lay their eggs now .
So , as any sensible bird would do , he moves south . They move south . The whole population moves south .
regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google .
Estonia accused Russia .
Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black ?
I come from Johannesburg , which is a mining town .
SP : But is this necessarily a bad thing ?
RNG : So if human nature didn &apos;t change , what invigorated those better angels ?
RNG : Oh , they did . Here &apos;s the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case .
RNG : And the persecution of homosexuals .
That &apos;s a four percent reduction per year -- and this , with measuring .
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
So we calculate the percent reduction per year , but it &apos;s sort of the same percentage .
And here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
And in discovery phase , we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring .
And the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system .
And you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much .
It would be , as Ed Felton once famously said , &quot; Like handing out water that wasn &apos;t wet . &quot;
And if you &apos;re not an American citizen , you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same .
So what you &apos;ll see up there is that it &apos;s really like the atmosphere of an open field , and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy .
I &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives .
And then the students would come into our sound studios , they would make their own rap songs with their own beats .
By making these partnerships that I described to you , I have really opened my mind and , I have to say , my heart to have a greater understanding , to make other discoveries about nature and myself .
Now , here &apos;s a secret you probably know already : Your stories are constructed .
Media tells us every day what &apos;s important , by the stories they choose and where they place them .
And I &apos;ll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in &#91; 1987 &#93; when I was a student in London .
And I don &apos;t even have any help . &quot;
We started with the prescription pad -- a very ordinary piece of paper -- and we asked , not what do patients need to get healthy -- antibiotics , an inhaler , medication -- but what do patients need to be healthy , to not get sick in the first place ?
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the 11 million college students in this country ?
I just wanted a blessing , I didn &apos;t want some kind of mandate .
And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him , &quot; Well what do you think ? &quot;
I found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rope .
An inner howl assails me , the wild longing to flee .
Because all those people were made up of people who , for the most part , considered each other enemies .
By inspiring ourselves we inspire others .
I passed them really well , but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground .
That &apos;s pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper . Right ?
Your homework is -- you know , how does an aircraft &apos;s wing create lift ?
But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action .
I mean , I empathize with that person but I don &apos;t literally feel the touch .
None of the glamour that you see today existed .
Now that is historic . It &apos;s never happened before in history .
The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions , etc . , etc .
It is also unstable .
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
In a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain .
So in other words , it almost always starts from the bottom up .
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce .
What does that mean ?
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness -- more happiness with less stuff .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Completely mechanical . This whole machine is mechanical .
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her .
That &apos;s been done . The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
In addition , it &apos;s multi-spectral .
So here what we &apos;re trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space .
Adults find it comforting .
They understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap , as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels .
It &apos;s keeping me standing . It &apos;s involved in coordinated movement .
And they &apos;re controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .
And then what we get is our first mapping .
So roughly , we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .
Most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , &quot; Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X. &quot;
And so for those who are undaunted , but humbled by the complexity of the brain , the future awaits .
And it was a revelation .
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world .
She said , &quot; Those high notes are going to kill you . &quot;
Then in February of 2008 , my grandfather passed away .
It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius .
It &apos;s about living .
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day .
This May , we &apos;re going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton , and if we &apos;re very lucky , DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .
We have to beat that .
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier .
You know , it &apos;s such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs .
And you know , when he walked in , I could just tell that he saw them .
In this case , this guy &apos;s not liking what he &apos;s hearing .
&quot; Currently listening to Evan Williams . &quot; &quot; Currently listening to Evan Williams . &quot; &quot; Evan Williams -- &quot; Oh .
So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply .
In other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 percent more Earth than we &apos;ve got .
It &apos;s like the Earth doesn &apos;t care what we need .
I want to talk to you about fear .
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done .
This could be our finest hour .
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency .
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged .
The right to live like a human .
Every week , religious extremists take another African village .
We can &apos;t fix every problem , but the ones we can , I want to argue , we must .
The Clash wore big army boots , not sandals .
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries .
We can &apos;t afford to be cool and sit this one out .
Bono : All right . I wish for TED to truly show the power of information , its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one African country .
This is going to affect everything .
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life , is that it is scalable , it works over an extraordinary range .
But it &apos;s sublinear , and what that translates into is that , if you double the size of the organism , you actually only need 75 percent more energy .
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way .
And how do you avoid that ? Well we &apos;ve done it before .
And so that gives me an opportunity , because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world . And it &apos;s great , because it seems like every time I change jobs .
They seem very , very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate .
Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening , promising and will really be the future of design , is the idea of collective design .
This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment -- the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense , and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer -- bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer , and also pregnancy .
Thank you very much .
And that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , I won &apos;t be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
These words , they stuck with me .
The animal had virtually no control over the legs .
And me ?
It exists . What is a snob ?
She &apos;s simply too strange .
Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I &apos;ve just been outlining ?
I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon .
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them , and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge .
When you &apos;re typing on your Blackberry , Android , iPhone , don &apos;t bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout to hit the period and then a space and then try to capitalize the next letter .
You get it every time .
There &apos;s a will to fight , and in many countries , that fight is ongoing and is being won . In others , like mine , where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria , the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go .
Nigeria &apos;s telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world , after China . We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms . And nobody knows , except a few smart people .
So , huge things in construction , real estate , mortgage markets . Financial services : we had 89 banks . Too many not doing their real business .
One of the women in this video , Adenike Ogunlesi , making children &apos;s clothes -- which she started as a hobby and grew into a business .
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad , then that &apos;s what jihad must mean .
They &apos;re fighting battles over much narrower issues .
Who killed bin Ladenism ? Al Jazeera did , Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
And sometimes -- actually , once it was on Page Six in the Post , that I was cruising this guy , like , sort of , whatever , but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on .
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ?
And at least , you know , in my case , because if I just do one thing all the time , I don &apos;t know , I get very , very bored . I bore very easily .
Too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that &apos;s so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio , like for a day show . Some kind of day talk show .
IM : It looks good , yeah ?
IM : Yeah , but I can never find buttermilk , ever .
You know that all of the cool people are -- they &apos;re doing it .
But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically .
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer , a program that says , manufacture these parts .
It &apos;s self-lit , you don &apos;t need any overhead lighting , so the neighbors don &apos;t complain about metal-halide lighting in their face .
Well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
The first actor is the Security Council .
It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where , when we got to a post-conflict situation , there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties .
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector .
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it &apos;s not just that the money is wasted -- that &apos;s the least of the problems -- it &apos;s that the money is captured .
Scissors are your clothes , glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles , and books are , after all , your education .
We have , actually , a pretty good working definition of complexity .
Now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device .
And then I would propose as this last component that they serve , or have the potential to serve , as building blocks .
But it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differentiates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual merit to asking : How do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can ?
Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we &apos;re going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren &apos;t in .
To be able to excavate the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out , you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions .
This was the cover of Science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same . Anyway , smaller raptors .
PS : Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off ! Don &apos;t get off !
The best way to test this is to actually create a model .
Niger is equally important , and I &apos;m trying desperately to do something in Niger .
So there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us , but with immediate latent value to someone else .
Now what I find fascinating about these examples is how they &apos;re actually tapping into our primate instincts .
Now , the third system is product-service systems .
We &apos;ve gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies , such as Zipcar and GoGet , to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry , which is peer-to-peer car rental , where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor .
Homework is stressful , but when you go home every day and your home is work , you don &apos;t want to pick up any assignments .
I can tell you that every official that I &apos;ve ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean .
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says , &quot; Oh , this is an important letter . &quot;
The Prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study .
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up .
So the inference we are deriving from this , and several such experiments , is that dynamic information processing , or motion processing , serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition .
Instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been .
So I &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean defiling the Earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way .
The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
The deeper we get into these issues , the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems .
We &apos;re now seeing companies embrace this idea .
&quot; And then you looked at the guy next to me , and you smiled , and you reached in your bucket , and you pulled out a lollipop , and you held it out to him , and you said , &apos; You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you . &apos; &quot; And she said , &quot; I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life .
But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
And I wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dismiss ?
From there , I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home .
You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself .
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it &apos;s somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine .
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
The choice in this case is pretty simple .
And finally , you understand what those choices are .
Then we went to CRP test .
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .
So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called &quot; oyster-tecture . &quot;
And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive .
Steven Levitt : Surprising stats about child carseats
And so , anyway , here I am . It &apos;s not a fairy tale .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting logic , I think , that people use . And the other logic , they say , &quot; Well , the government wouldn &apos;t have told us &#91; to &#93; use them if they weren &apos;t much better . &quot;
I would like you to approve it for selling , &quot; then they would say , &quot; This is a fantastic new car seat , it works great .
And he would say , listen , I know I gave you that huge pill , that complicated , hard-to-swallow pill before , but now I &apos;ve got one that &apos;s so potent , that is really tiny and small and almost invisible .
Well folks , I &apos;m here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it .
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia .
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything .
But maybe it &apos;s a bad thing as well .
I think there are ways -- and I &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
And like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
What is a calendar ?
They don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
I want to conclude .
But probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
Now , 21 billion hours , it &apos;s a lot of time .
And we &apos;re going to come back to this one .
But not everybody has a concussion , obviously , not everyone wants to be &quot; the slayer , &quot; so I renamed the game SuperBetter .
We &apos;re going to play a quick game together .
All right , now what we &apos;re just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience , which means you have the ability to provoke powerful , positive emotions like curiosity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most .
And with 10 extra years , you might even have enough time to play a few more games .
You need absolutely the right mountain if you &apos;re going to have a clock for 10,000 years .
And in fact , pretty soon we &apos;ll hear the sound .
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right .
We want a temporary use permit for the clock , eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit .
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered .
And the third is the experience from the mountain , which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny , and if you look off to the right , out there , 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range .
Hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs , going into management ain &apos;t no success story . It &apos;s a failure .
If I used someone else &apos;s pre-death , I apologize , I think I made it up .
So that &apos;s , to me , a way forward .
If you &apos;re not passionate about your own company , why on Earth should anyone else be passionate ?
There &apos;s never been an angel- or a venture-funded company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
And it &apos;s revving up to the very end , and then at the very end you &apos;ve got to -- boom ! -- knock them out of the park .
That shows me that -- if you can &apos;t even do a presentation , how the heck can you run a company ?
I know the day , I know who I am , I know you &apos;re presenting .
Even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
And I look at the logo -- okay , good .
You &apos;re making a connection with your audience over here , and you always want to do a one-on-one connection .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power .
This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
In the face of America &apos;s worst destruction people are building again .
And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled , and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process .
DR : Yeah . So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims , through the city , to make sure that they knew this was happening .
Richard , I think very correctly , made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal , banal , common problem of sitting .
The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings , which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings .
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable .
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ?
They said , &quot; Hey Ze , if you ever come to Boulder , you should rock out with us , &quot; and I said , &quot; Why wait ? &quot;
It &apos;s the third in the series .
They actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we &apos;re lacking . And very , very quickly -- I love puppets . Here &apos;s a puppet .
You can show the Capitol -- I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book , in fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy ?
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East , and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism .
That &apos;s not the way human circumstances operate .
So , rather than have it fight or do industrial work , we decided to build a planter , put the robot into the center of it , and we called it the Telegarden .
Now , the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital .
She &apos;s eight years old , and she likes robots , too .
It &apos;s getting pretty close to finished now .
You know , this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight-year-old can use .
Things like the buildings , and the vehicles , the architecture , civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point .
So in fact , we &apos;re going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here . Now , as we move into the future , and we start going out in this space and doing stuff , we &apos;re drawing a lot from things like science fiction .
And so that &apos;s why I think , personally , that toys can change the world .
And how does he respond to this anxiety ?
But rest assured : so are you .
Well , what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?
Tonight you &apos;ll see some of our invented stents .
That &apos;s the first invention that I wanted to describe .
Robert Fischell : And that is the invention to treat migraines .
We want to have some people , who really know how to do this , perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .
Well , then let &apos;s go to a simpler explanation .
Only the best ones can survive .
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is &quot; Better City , Better Life . &quot;
This is where people normally object that it doesn &apos;t sound very sustainable to sail water from Copenhagen to China .
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments .
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert . It has no vegetation .
And then what happens is there &apos;s enough dust left over that it doesn &apos;t ignite into a star , it becomes a planet .
Difference human / Neanderthal is sperm and testis , smell and skin .
That &apos;s a big deal .
What we do know is , potentially , the brain is reacting in a hyperactive , hyper-plastic way , and creating individuals that are like this .
What are catastrophic effects ? A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction .
This will apply to people across all of America .
When are we going to do it ? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years ?
So you know , when you stick this idea ...
I &apos;ve always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions , but I did finally figure it out . I had to figure it out , because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector , so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would .
I mean , it seems to work for a lot of things .
So , the alarm goes off and it &apos;s five to 12 or so .
I mean , you always peel one layer off another ; we think of them as pages , doing it a certain way .
He &apos;s taught them to spell his name , which is Aldo .
As we look at the drawing board , we see what he &apos;s working on is , in fact , a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken , and the red line extends through all the sights .
The man on top can see , the blind man can walk .
And it &apos;s taught us really one thing , and that is to truly make good public space , you have to erase the distinctions between architecture , urbanism , landscape , media design and so on .
Very , very difficult to mount shows in there .
It had to be approved by actually two agencies .
But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones .
I think it may seem like I &apos;m ignoring the policy stuff , which is really the most important , but I &apos;m hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works .
So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003 , but I can &apos;t tell you anything about 1993 or 1983 .
The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight , who got the disease in Africa and brought it back .
And I hope that I &apos;ve convinced you maybe that it &apos;s important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy .
At age 31 -- that &apos;s my age now -- in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming , and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming .
The arm is extended below the head .
But I said , &quot; Please rape me at eight a.m. &quot;
And so I ended up walking like this .
Then one month later , went to the world championships , made it to the semi-final . And then set a world record , following that , two weeks later .

So what about making energy ?
So , about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component .
So after looking at these three , and 47 others , we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use .
We measured each one , we readjusted the model to what we measured , and then we led that to the current prototype .
We &apos;re very excited about the progress , we do have a very long way to go though still , and let me tell you a little bit more about that .
Of course , now I &apos;m very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake .
All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited .
And so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left .
The public self , the beauty , the intellect , and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again .
She basically created the dances in &quot; Oklahoma , &quot; transforming the American theater .
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution , but I &apos;d like to argue that it &apos;s done ; we won .
All the intelligence is external to the system ; the materials don &apos;t have information .
Just year after year -- and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person .
Real invention is happening in these labs .
Well , this is 2009 .
It &apos;s not a minority theory .
All his colleagues said , &quot; This is outrageous .
Well they do know , that if you look at other aquatic mammals , the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall , around the kidneys and the intestines and so on , has started to migrate to the outside , and spread out in a layer inside the skin .
And if you &apos;ve got a scientific problem like that , you can &apos;t solve it by holding a head count , and saying , &quot; More of us say yes than say no . &quot;
&quot; Horizon , &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
&apos;I &apos;m being pushed into a grave . The situation is grave , &apos; I moan .
It &apos;s a flat surface . It &apos;s safe . &apos; Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me .
They &apos;re different from me and you .
I could no longer deny the truth , and I could not change it .
College presidents are not the first people who come to mind when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination .
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough , I can assure you , to give one pause , what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .
Even more valuable , history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual , as well as the intended consequences of ideas .
We actually do it all the time .
So what that meant was , when I went down to Fort Dix , I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision .
Jon Baril : The worst thing in my life .
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save .
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall , shaking and screaming .
I knew about that journal , but it was very , very private .
The gunner was throwing candy .
Why ?
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act , I realize I &apos;ve never been happier .
Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure .
I mean , as girls , we start off feisty -- &quot; Yeah , who says ? &quot;
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood , to getting something else .
Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years , each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony . So why , seven years ago , did colonies start dying en masse ? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences . This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world &apos;s crops . Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us ?
So in my lab , we study how bees keep themselves healthy .
And then there &apos;s pesticides .
Set aside farmland .
This year , Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I &apos;ll preview today , called Whole Earth Discipline .
Now they &apos;re showing us how they do their phone service .
Because people leave the poverty trap , an ecological disaster of subsistence farms , and head to town .
Wind and solar can &apos;t help , because so far we don &apos;t have a way to store that energy .
My fellow environmentalists , on this subject , have been irrational , anti-scientific , and very harmful .
Thank you .
In the last century , it killed 500 million people .
It wouldn &apos;t do just to vaccinate everyone .
You can &apos;t cure or prevent what you don &apos;t know is there .
What we really want is to arrive right here , so we can stop the epidemic .
H5N1 . It was in Hong Kong . And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds , and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks .
But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain .
Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully .
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn &apos;t .
As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
Shimon Steinberg looks at the difference between pests and bugs -- and makes the case for using good bugs to fight bad bugs , avoiding chemicals in our quest for perfect produce . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
And after five minutes , this is what you see : just a typical dead corpse , shriveled , sucked-out , dead corpse of the spider mite , and next to it , two satiated individuals of predatory mites , a mother on the left-hand side , a young nymph on the right-hand side .
And this is of course not the end of it .
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon .
Secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of 10 , 20 people would caravan across the United States , and they would form companies .
Husband # 2 : Not for another 15 minutes . After all , it &apos;s your special day .
And this was huge . The first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan .
You &apos;d keep this on your porch . It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain .
And if you believe that , then you believe that where we are -- this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and I haven &apos;t even talked about user interfaces on the Web -- but there &apos;s so much kludge , so much terrible stuff -- we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet .
And my mother was a kind of a designer , also .
Remember that moment ? It felt so good , didn &apos;t it ?
And so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again , hard to do with our hands .
He was such an inspirational guy .
Because of that , I became interested in blue tape , so in San Francisco , at C.C. , I had a whole exhibition on blue tape .
So , three years ago I discovered , the letters M-I-T occurring in simplicity and complexity .
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere greatly .
Their kids are in the water ; they &apos;re getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals . It &apos;s a mess .
That guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
They breed in the high arctic , and they winter down in southern South America .
But really , where are those birds going to get released to ?
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .
Let me explain this in a little more detail .
Let &apos;s take this sentence : &quot; I told the carpenter I could not pay him . &quot;
In about 1997 , about 15 years back , there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language , and they found something very interesting .
Now if you think about it , FreeSpeech , I told you , is completely language-independent .
I read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because I &apos;m a word person .
Big masculine threat , insinuating and slangy . &quot;
And it can make us afraid .
About the same time , she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie , which is a couple of hours away , and she was going to drive them in her car , but the school said , &quot; No , you can &apos;t drive them in the car for liability reasons .
Absolutely vital .
That means all the boys are going to be ADD .
And it is this : Law sets boundaries , and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can &apos;t do or must do -- you can &apos;t steal , you &apos;ve got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom .
It doesn &apos;t mean that people in authority can do whatever they want .
China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot;
And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
They carried bayonets on their rifles .
And so I engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .
They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman , who said to them , &quot; You fought not only the enemy but prejudice , and you won . &quot;
So we are speaking about transformation , transformation in rural areas .
But after this , we have empirical evidence that 82 percent , on average , among all these villages -- 1,200 villages have completed it -- waterborne diseases have come down 82 percent .
Here &apos;s some data from actually just 10 days ago , which shows this year &apos;s minimum of the Arctic Sea ice , and it &apos;s the lowest by far .
There &apos;s no big mystery about it .
And in fact , he had some ideas to make them go away .
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
And we have global celebrations , and we &apos;ve actually started to -- you know , we &apos;ve seen the worst of it .
My oh my , walking by , who &apos;s the apple of my eye ? Why , it &apos;s my very own Clonie . Oh , if I should stroll the hood , who knew I could look so good just talking on the phone to Clonie . We are pals , it &apos;s cool , &apos; cause we &apos;re not lonely , shallow gene pool is nothing to my only Clonie . Me and you , hustling through , holding on through thick and thin , just day by day , our DNA , so the Olson twins got nothing on us . We &apos;ll survive , side by side . Mother Nature , don &apos;t you call her phony , she &apos;s my Clonie . Was wealthy , but not healthy , had no one to dwell with me , so look who I got born -- Clonie . Far from broke , bored , rich folk , we don &apos;t need no natural yolk -- our babies come full-formed , Clonie . We &apos;ll be huggable , get a publicist and show them , be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem . Oh my friend , multiply , we &apos;re a franchise , like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lecter . We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector . We &apos;ll survive side by side , should have signed with Verve instead of Sony . You &apos;re my Clonie . &quot; Oh Clonie , how I love you . &quot;
Just wire the chimps up to love that look , and apparently they do .
How will we be remembered in 200 years ?
There are plans to do it , but it &apos;s hard .
So , the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it .
That &apos;s another wonderful opportunity that &apos;s opening .
I &apos;m saying , where do they go when they &apos;re like me ?
That &apos;s Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi .
No ? Yes ? Doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
Paul Pholeros : How to reduce poverty ? Fix homes
And the highest priority , you see on the screen , is washing people once a day , particularly children .
They &apos;re actually about improving houses .
Well , first thing we do , we get showers working .
So all of a sudden we had two problems .
We need to take our responsibilities seriously , but not ourselves .
I invited our new CEO , and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels , his reaction was very simple : &quot; Let &apos;s make this happen .
Sadly , this leads me to another three Bs that represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers , billionaires and belly dancers .
And social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just can &apos;t develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market .
As if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy .
They were taught that self-interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation .
What if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted 71 million dollars because it did ?
It &apos;s called Sankofa .
I played a little baseball , did a few other things like that , but I always had the sense of being an outsider , and it wasn &apos;t until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate , I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s for me , &quot; you know ?
Simple as that , right ? No biggie .
This one , a little sketchy going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
These are my peers .
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation .
In the New England Journal of Medicine , there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming , people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems .
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla , and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans .
And one of the things we wondered -- I &apos;m sure some of you out there are economists , and you know all about supply and demand .
Rufus Griscom + Alisa Volkman : Let &apos;s talk parenting taboos
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child .
RG : That is not fair . This is a trick question . He &apos;s not up there , is he ?
And of course , it made me question , if I wasn &apos;t able to have another child , what would that mean for my marriage , and just me as a woman .
And part of what happens , I think , in your &apos; 20s and &apos; 30s , is you start to learn to hedge your happiness .
My son designed a rocket that became stable , a golf ball rocket -- I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science -- and it flies straight as an arrow .
And in many ways , I try to capture the mishaps ; it &apos;s the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second .
And the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it &apos;s the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
And it &apos;s maturing up to the present time .
It &apos;s not just throwing them out at random .
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .
So I &apos;m going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .
If you go on the TED website , you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos , over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings .
For example , fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color , much more than the average TEDTalk .
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator .
And there was a designated kicker every day .
The experiment is this : Is it possible to have institutions in our country , universities , where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience ?
It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students -- their grades , the rigor of the course work , their test-taking skills , their attitude , the fire in their belly , the passion for the work , to make it .
Whether you &apos;re talking about artists producing artists or you &apos;re talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example -- you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries , where students are not there just to survive , where they love learning , where they enjoy being the best , where they will one day change the world .
Thomas Thwaites : As you can see , they had the Christmas decorations up .
And it was looking good for a while , but I left it outside , because you had to leave it outside to dry , and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .
Right now , every second , eight new users are joining the Internet .
Or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in China &apos;s recent campaign against America .
It creates some very serious alerts .
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
And I should mention as well that some of you do use your names , &quot; James Lyne &apos;s iPhone , &quot; for example .
That all depends on our motivation .
When the environmentalists speak with economists , it &apos;s like a schizophrenic dialogue , completely incoherent .
My friend , Daniel Batson , spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations .
Now , if we want a more altruistic society , we need two things : individual change and societal change .
Myself , I will go back to the East .
But recently , we &apos;ve become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect , from creating sight-specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts .
Instead , they use tools like Skype , which they think are immune to interception .
&#91; &quot; Windows , OS X , iOS , Android , Blackberry , Symbian , Linux &quot; &#93; You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data .
Roz Savage : Why I &apos;m rowing across the Pacific
Sure , I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what I &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
Worst ever , 13 miles in the wrong direction .
So , the following year , I set out and , fortunately , this time made it safely across to Hawaii .
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues , to bring a human face to the ocean .
It &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
To sell his idea , he became a showman .
During my visit I &apos;ve been especially honored to meet some of Britain &apos;s most extraordinary women -- women who are paving the way for all of you .
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign .
You too can pave the way .
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago .
It &apos;s easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields , like sports and entertainment .
As income inequality increases , social mobility decreases .
Everything , I would say . Everything that matters except every thing and except matter .
Consciousness . I see all your faces .
Because that &apos;s where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .
And he said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve no idea .
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time .
So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible .
If you understand the difference between &apos; the world &apos; and &apos; my world , &apos; you understand the difference between logos and mythos .
What a waste of a life . &quot;
Because , you see , nothing lasts forever in India , not even death .
But in India there is no &quot; the &quot; promised land .
How do you put it in a nice little software ? You can &apos;t .
And it has .
My friend Manya , when she was a student at university in California , was earning money by working for a car dealer .
Now , we delivered the conference in such a way .
We might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices , and that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t succeed .
You had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities .
Paris was a series of these little villages that came together , and you still see that structure today .
You don &apos;t need reverse . You don &apos;t need parallel parking .
So if you can have folding and autonomy , you can do that in one seventh of the space .
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well , but somehow it doesn &apos;t happen with the same intensity .
So you have your million .
That &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils , you multiply immunization rate by six .
But what politicians need is a range of options .
That doesn &apos;t sound like that much when you think about it .
I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference , but can we come back here in 30 years and say , &quot; What we have done , it really prompted a change for the better . &quot;
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next .
It really is Microsoft &apos;s Office . It &apos;s Adobe &apos;s Photoshop .
So there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law .
The thing that got Martha Payne &apos;s opinions out into the public was a piece of technology , but the thing that kept them there was political will .
The project began in &apos; 57 at General Atomics there .
That &apos;s my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase .
Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side .
Today we have 200 countries in the world .
So history doesn &apos;t necessarily repeat itself , but it does rhyme .
What &apos;s emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere .
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone , without infrastructure , is futile .
And that is , of course , Europe .
It has three ongoing civil wars , the genocide in Darfur , which you all know about , the civil war in the east of the country , and south Sudan .
And I didn &apos;t have the patience to wait until I reached home .
This is called &quot; Dawn to Dawn . &quot;
So the lamp is not just giving a light , it &apos;s also giving a darkness .
And if they say it &apos;s solid , it will not be solid , it will evaporate .
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow .
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .
And then they morph into violent extremism .
But we also hadn &apos;t pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch .
Rape is used as a weapon of war , instilling fear and depopulating whole areas .
Even if I could have afforded the phone bills home , like most people in the Congo , my parents did not own a phone line .
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time .
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood , he fires an arrow , which trails a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line .
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park , and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see .
Some of you might know that , in 1990 , Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder , and he had tattooed on his right shoulder &quot; Winona forever . &quot;
And second of all , it requires imagination .
And for the first several hours , there was exactly one thought in my head .
Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos , and I &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
And as I said earlier , I &apos;m a perfectionist .
It &apos;s completely intuitive ; there &apos;s no instruction manual .
Now this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization . For instance , I think we all really enjoyed Hans Rosling &apos;s talk , and he really emphasized the fact that I &apos;ve been thinking about for a long time too : we have all this great data , but for some reason , it &apos;s just sitting there .
I &apos;m scared and I &apos;m angry . &quot; And then she turned to me and said , &quot; Dad , your generation created this problem ; you &apos;d better fix it . &quot; Wow .
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year .
He &apos;s the father of the ethanol revolution .
And we &apos;re encouraging others to do it as well .
What can you do ? You can personally get carbon neutral .
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice , and we said to the Ministry of Justice , what &apos;s it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-offend ?
Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people .
We &apos;ve met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences .
And can we afford not to ? Thank you .
So what will this do ?
It &apos;s going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall .
But luckily , as my favorite action hero , Bob the Builder , says , &quot; We can do better . We can build this better . &quot;
And this is a dynamic in which to succeed , players have to do something at a predefined time , generally at a predefined place .
We all want that credit card on the far left because it &apos;s black .
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good .
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known .
I &apos;m extrapolating .
But you can even do other things , because in these maritime routes , there are regular patterns .
But here we are , 20 years on , and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the iPad , not HAL .
It displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called &quot; meaningful adjacency . &quot;
Instead , people will have to look at data and search for insight , and as Licklider foresaw long ago , the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation , and as Kasparov realized , that means minimizing friction at the interface .
Thank you .
Rich Player : I have money for everything .
In one of these studies , we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk .
In one study , we had people watch a brief video , just 46 seconds long , about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them , and after watching that , we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress .
So Steve and I , through mathematical analysis , propose that there &apos;s actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this , which lies in our brains .
But nevertheless , what the potential is -- and just keep looking there -- what the potential is , obviously , is to kind of move the border of who is the author , and who is the receiver .
And if I vote it makes a difference .
And why would we want to do that ?
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
Now , you &apos;re all going to consume the tea .
You know the feedback , whether you &apos;re solving the puzzles or not .
The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is , I was at a dinner party , and a woman heard that I work in computer security , and she asked me if -- she said her computer had been infected by a virus , and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it , that she could get this virus .
One is short-range wireless , where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby , either through Bluetooth or wi-fi , and the other is long-range , where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network , or through one of the radio stations .
They wrote software to stabilize -- even though they were on a bus and maybe someone &apos;s holding their phone at an angle -- to stabilize the phone , process it , and you may know on your smartphone , when you type a password , the keys pop out a little bit , and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing , and had a language model for detecting typing .
They typed in , &quot; The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago &quot; — see , I tied it in to the last talk — &quot; and ordered him to stay on the ballot . &quot;
There &apos;ll be days like this , my momma said . When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises ; when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape ; when your boots will fill with rain , and you &apos;ll be up to your knees in disappointment .
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry .
We stayed full-time students , but in between we traveled , performing and teaching nine-year-olds to MFA candidates , from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus .
Not everyone can read music or owns a camera , but everyone can communicate in some way , and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from .
But in Hiroshima , some people were wiped clean away , leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page .
Because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error .
This is one of them .
And aggregated , these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system , up to a seven inch rain event , up to a hundred-year storm .
And every green space we create is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us .
So updates from a beaver .
I was quite shocked by that , and thought to myself , &quot; Well , OK then .
This is a tunnel that &apos;s abandoned in Hell &apos;s Kitchen .
There are also phone cables that were used in the &apos; 50s and many bunkers from the World War II era .
We &apos;ve got edible canal towpaths , and we &apos;ve got sprouting cemeteries .
And there &apos;s been lots of other examples , like the corn that was in front of the police station , and the old people &apos;s home that we &apos;ve planted it with food that they can pick and grow .
This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway .
But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like .
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own .
I ask the question , how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ? &quot;
But you don &apos;t know what a sphere looks like .
We have these technologies . We use them .
These babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second .
We do have the technology that &apos;s scaleable , and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be accomplished .
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
This is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean , there &apos;s -- are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
And humans do the same thing .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
These kinds of things . People are bringing their true selves , basically . They &apos;re bringing themselves .
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
And this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do .
This universe is described by being a network of relationships .
21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas : the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand .
We can all think of someone , often a young woman , who has been impacted by breast cancer .
And she started , in the face of a lot of controversy , the Women &apos;s Health Initiative .
So we said , &quot; Look , women look like they &apos;re pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away , smoothly putting it away .
These are our life-saving treatments .
You now , hopefully , have a more personal relationship with your heart .
I would later find out that was Houdini &apos;s personal record .
And when I was researching pearl divers , I found the world of free-diving .
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .
Every morning , again , after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out .
So , normally I would start at 38 beats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
And I think that there is some weird thing -- that I had died or something had happened .
But now , what does religion have to do with it ?
Look at China . They &apos;re falling fairly fast .
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
Each card box is one billion people .
When this picture appeared , that well-known scientific journal , The New York Times , wrote in its editorial , &quot; Mars is uninteresting .
We believe there &apos;s some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole .
That record exists on Mars .
We will fly where the methane is .
We put the folded airplane on the balloon -- it took about three hours to get up there -- and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet , and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly .
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature , and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea .
The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life ?
If I do like you , I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends .
So what are we waiting for ?
Then he practices for another and takes lessons -- now he &apos;s 10 .
You know , you &apos;ve come home from a long day , and you take a glass of wine , and you put your feet up .
But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you , but because of us ?
So this is a piece which goes from away to home .
They say three percent of the population likes classical music .
And so when she came out of Auschwitz , she made a vow .
This is where you &apos;ll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside New Delhi , where I met these characters who showed me around for the day .
Well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspects to it .
Here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
There are two basic types of innovation .
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it .
Companies like De La Guarda , which I produce , and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action , but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level .
You know , had efferent , afferent , and haptic response .
Going to scratch his nose .
It turns out that colonies are different .
But as soon as the threat is passed , the entrance is open again , and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat , and then open it again , instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress .
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up , you know , &quot; Bad design is just people not thinking , John , &quot; he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or , say , a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen .
My life , at the mercy of good design and bad design .
It &apos;s reassuring ; people are drawn to it .
What a liberating thought ! Yes !
Gods we &apos;re still fighting about . Oh yeah .
We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos .
There &apos;s Teodorín Obiang .
He used shell companies .
Corruption in that sector , no surprise .
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp ; that &apos;s not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect .
So , if you stagger into the head late at night and you &apos;re so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light , you may think that you &apos;re having a religious experience .
This little guy has no visible means of self-support .
The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles .
And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what &apos;s in them , and she &apos;s right .
So that &apos;s the question . The question is , how much -- they are doing a similar amount of processing , similar amount of data -- the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use ?
I mean , neurons have thousands of these .
And it &apos;s brittle , because each of these steps has to be flawless , otherwise you lose that data , whereas in the brain , you have a system that stores data in a distributed way , and it &apos;s robust .
There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it .
And Jane Goodall , making her own special connection , photographed by Nick Nichols .
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad , called Zakouma .
Jonas Bendiksen , a very energetic photographer , came to me and said , &quot; We need to document this , and here &apos;s my proposal .
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals .
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day .
But they basically created a digital puppet of her , where you can pull on these various strings , and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took .
But I think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
And these winds up there can be very , very fierce .
All those cloud shapes at the beginning , those were cumulus clouds .
And later , in the mid- &apos; 80s , when &quot; Jeopardy &quot; came back on the air , I remember running home from school every day to watch the show .
It was a scatter chart showing performance on &quot; Jeopardy , &quot; tens of thousands of dots representing &quot; Jeopardy &quot; champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of -- I was going to say questions answered , but answers questioned , I guess , clues responded to -- versus the accuracy of those answers .
I felt obsolete .
There &apos;s just too much .
That &apos;s often the advantage of time .
Feeling like the world is becoming less friendly ? Social theorist Jonathan Zittrain begs to difffer . The Internet , he suggests , is made up of millions of disinterested acts of kindness , curiosity and trust .
It &apos;s very complicated , but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly .
And yet , somehow , within about two hours , the problem was fixed .
&quot; Anon attacking me for reverting . &quot;
You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler .
CouchSurfing : one guy &apos;s idea to , at last , put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger &apos;s couch for free , with people who live far away , and would like someone they don &apos;t know to sleep on their couch for free .
With much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
One is asking for angur -- one is , say , an Englishman -- one is asking for eneb , and one is asking for grapes .
And , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
I think I should want to , but actually I &apos;d rather just do things on my Blackberry . &quot;
It seemed to be following the conversation .
Now it &apos;s : I want to have a feeling , I need to send a text .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You &apos;ll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking .
And of course , theoretically , it does , and if you look at older texts , then people used it to actually indicate laughing out loud .
You don &apos;t just zip right into it .
Thank you very much .
This is a little plot , and every time you show a plot , you lose 10 percent of the audience .
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call , somebody to call , the government to call . Nobody called .
Now , look , a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country .
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because SETI involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronomy , but also geology , also chemistry , various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of , &quot; We &apos;re looking for E.T. &quot;
It &apos;s time to start designing for our ears .
They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in . Let &apos;s stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now , please .
We &apos;re at last starting to debate this issue , and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education , unbelievable .
What went wrong between the design studio and the factory ?
And I have to ask the question -- VC &apos;s always ask , &quot; Sir , what is your business , and who is your customer ? &quot;
But without training , without some kind of light meter , how would you know ?
And the idea here is it &apos;s obvious how you ought to use this device .
We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been improved , and very simple things turned out .
It was quite a compelling experience , but not really , I suppose , a surprise to someone who &apos;d had his room full of the books .
But these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there &apos;s a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market .
But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant . It is resistant to Tamiflu .
So we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen , and steer us to a lower-risk place .
If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
A verbal response would not be appropriate .
I can remember someone saying this to me , with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God .
Maybe God isn &apos;t an agent like all of us are agents .
If God is in all people , then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter .
It goes 150 miles an hour .
And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
But , you know , I could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and -- Now , the Kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
In Argentina , there are 50,000 .
And it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
And it &apos;s worth probably about three MacBook Pros .
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types .
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
But not all positions in the network are the same .
And that happens at every peripheral node .
Information spreads in populations , norms can spread in populations , behaviors can spread in populations .
Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
Now the current goal isn &apos;t something like , I want to be president or the best surfer in the world .
It allows us to make sense of the world around us .
Now we also need to repeat it . We need to practice .
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !
I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it .
Become a catalyst of change . Teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
I was going to ask you which one you picked , but no need .
It &apos;s based on more voluntary deference , and even elements of love , at times .
Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group , authority , purity .
It shoots up and it keeps going up .
So as Edmund Burke said , &quot; The restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights . &quot;
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama -- and it comes from his moral humility .
So the human brain is larger than it should be , it uses much more energy than it should , so it &apos;s special .
And so was Darwin .
With this large brain now affordable by cooking , we went rapidly from raw foods to culture , agriculture , civilization , grocery stores , electricity , refrigerators , all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint .
They cannot wait . The others , of course , wait .
High on past-positive . Moderately high on future .
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly .
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . And I remember thinking , &quot; If I killed myself , no one would notice . &quot;
And it &apos;s only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat .
And I think you can see around us now , some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow .
And what &apos;s striking though , is that in society there &apos;s almost nothing comparable , no comparable investment , no systematic experiment , in the things capitalism isn &apos;t very good at , like compassion , or empathy , or relationships or care .
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .
I moved for two years in Taiwan .
It &apos;s to have a look at different worlds .
And at one point , I had to do &quot; The Whole Nine Yards . &quot;
Why do I call it a book ?
But you have a bonus with this bench .
Now I hope all of you feel better .
And if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go .
That &apos;s how we churn those products out .
I think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
I just wanted to show quickly .
So , &quot; related searches , &quot; right there . You can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads , called &quot; related searches . &quot;
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
I am powerful , and I am strong .
Every child deserves a champion , an adult who will never give up on them , who understands the power of connection , and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be .
And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city .
So they &apos;re really an ideal model .
But the active irradiation , during the UV and for an hour after it , there is dilation of the blood vessels .
But when I became the attorney general , two things happened that changed the way I see criminal justice .
We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
They &apos;re like the baseball scouts 20 years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses .
It &apos;s how we can make our streets safer , we can reduce our prison costs , and we can make our system much fairer and more just .
We have David Attenborough .
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin .
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants &#91; continue &#93; to work .
From 1998 to 2000 , 21.37 million people lost their jobs in China .
The background of this piece is more complex , so I need three to four days in advance for preparation .
But let &apos;s keep things in proportion .
I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup .
If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law , it could be a model .
What we &apos;ve found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there &apos;s no female consensus .
Suppose we &apos;re distributing flutes .
He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability .
All right . Stay there , Charlie .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
Thank you very much .
The fact is , you can do it all with one towel .
Mick Cornett : How an obese town lost a million pounds
Now you know the lists I &apos;m talking about .
We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long , long time .
We &apos;ll have over 100 miles when we &apos;re through building it out .
But more importantly , the reason I wanted to show this picture : look where the other people are looking , and look where he is looking .
Tell them where to put it , and then just do what you want to do .
So , this is called Victoria Crater , which is about a few football fields in size .
What is he doing ?
And that would be bad .
On the right , also , we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going .
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed , that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun , a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together , and they formed bigger rocks , and then that &apos;s how the planets , you know , were formed .
So it could be Earth , frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it .
Now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
What SUNDAR stands for , in Hindi , is &quot; attractive . &quot;
Or we &apos;ll be here all day with my childhood stories .
And then at the other end , there &apos;s performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one , and outdoor installations like this one and this one .
He draws sticks real good . &quot;
So this is in Eastern Tennessee , and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death .
It was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things .
And all together with those other 77 you &apos;re not seeing , that &apos;s my biennial .
So that &apos;s what led me to Alzheimer &apos;s . I started reading about Alzheimer &apos;s and tried to familiarize myself with the research , and at the same time when I was in the -- I was reading in the medical library one day , and I read this article about something called &quot; purine derivatives . &quot;
And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body , or over 50 percent of our body . And so at first I kind of thought , &quot; Well , maybe there &apos;s some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn &apos;t get cancer -- at least not that I know of . &quot;
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn &apos;t express this type of molecules ?
And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly , fragile , obviously in the latter phase of active dying .
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years .
And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara , Kuan-Yin .
These are some of the products I &apos;ve worked on over the last 20 years , starting back from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on , and ending up most recently with the Treo , and we &apos;re continuing to do this .
Well , it took longer than four years . It &apos;s been about 16 years .
This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don &apos;t have a theory .
It was an intuitive , strong-held belief that was wrong .
It can run and hide . It has fears and emotions . It can eat you , you know .
And the altered door thought experiment says , you have a door at home , and when you &apos;re here , I &apos;m changing it , I &apos;ve got a guy back at your house right now , moving the door around , and they &apos;re going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches .
You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms .
I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them , they knew what they were doing was really significant , but they didn &apos;t really know what was going to happen .
I actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science .
Sure , the bruise hurts like hell , and you almost certainly don &apos;t like the discolored look , but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem .
Some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
It makes it hotter . It &apos;s happening right now .
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you .
Of course someday , in the deep future , a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented , rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric .
We &apos;ve talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself . You could be looking there at poverty , injustice , all those sorts of things which feed terrorism .
There &apos;s a very young , attractive lady over here , and she has something which I think &apos;s the worst form of psychological , physical injury I &apos;ve ever seen out of a suicide bombing : It &apos;s human shrapnel .
If we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
Whatever the point , it gets to the heart of the problem , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re talking to them .
What did get me moving was a social interaction .
And , very simply , and I &apos;m really cutting it short because of the time limits here , it &apos;s essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture , its political values , its foreign policies .
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set , and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom .
Because ultimately , that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world .
And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case .
It &apos;s turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior .
We try Skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don &apos;t really want to talk ; they want to play .
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance , people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .
What they care about is the robot .
Owl , yeah .
Girl : I just take off my CI , and I don &apos;t hear anything .
That &apos;s kind of hypnotic .
I &apos;ve been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I &apos;ve been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants .
But I tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
A hundred million people in the world are homeless .
Now obviously , every time I bring this up , people even , you know , here at the conference , say , &quot; Are you serious ? Thirty stories ? How &apos;s that going to happen ? &quot;
Buildings are starting to go up around the world .
By dancing . It &apos;s like this .
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth .
So I was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let &apos;s go one step further .
And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating , metabolizing , burning through chemistries .
But that &apos;s probably going to end in failure , so we need to be a bit more focused .
Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete ?
And when do you think that will happen ?
Almost nobody gets out of love alive .
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said , &quot; My longing had no time when it ceases . &quot;
And indeed , it has all of the characteristics of addiction .
And that &apos;s about it , that &apos;s all they know .
And the world &apos;s population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century .
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
That &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
Okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
Your Blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser .
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they &apos;re flying around , which is kind of fun .
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule , which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low , subsidized price -- in fact , a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells .
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel , printing , gunpowder .
And you &apos;ll need to attract families , the residents who will come and live there permanently , raise their children , get an education for their children , and get their first job .
Others will hold back . But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . &quot;
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable .
They are self-aware , they are predictive , reactive and social .
Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing .
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices .
It is a very useful concept , but behaviorally , it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world .
you might be able to look at brain activity and say , &quot; This person &apos;s going to be a good poker player , &quot; or , &quot; This person &apos;s socially naive , &quot; and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists .
So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time , and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that &apos;s active first in time , and the arrowhead goes to the region that &apos;s active later .
Wrong .
So here are some things we learned today .
The Republicans say , hey , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea .
We &apos;re not open to a discussion of eliminating it .
They &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ideologically , who consistently support , &quot; No we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; or , &quot; No , we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism . &quot;
The best culinary experience of my life .
That is until last year , when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur , the coveted French gastronomic prize .
I &apos;m talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , I slowed down .
And they are allowed to take whatever they want .
And this squadron of geese come over .
I &apos;d had something that was called foie gras .
He said , &quot; I think it &apos;s an insult to history . &quot;
It &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
And then , not only for war victims , but it was for any kind of patient .
I wondered , what work ?
But they insisted .
And we ran .
He said , &quot; I am a scrap of a man , but if you help me , I &apos;m ready to do anything , even if I have to crawl on the ground . &quot;
We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .
I said , &quot; No , &quot; you can imagine .
So much so , that much of my work till that time was in the English language .
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country .
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .
But that &apos;s not enough , what he did . Look at what he did here .
But if I had to get a match to match , obviously , I would need a different design of a cellphone .
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only .
Products have gone to the market , a few .
And the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
And just watch the change in colors in India , China , Europe , sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us .
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses .
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
TD : But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all , I could share with you a little story about myself .
TC : My relationship to this concept of heart-to-heart connection , or mind-to-mind connection , is an interesting one , because , as a spiritual leader , I &apos;m always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections in a genuine way with other people , but at the same time , I &apos;ve always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart-to-heart connections , because , being someone in a position like mine , if I don &apos;t rely primarily on intelligence , then something dangerous may happen to me .
So 14 years ago , almost , in the middle of the Rwandan genocide , in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia .
It &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
The second is , of course , that at this time in particular in America &apos;s history , we have a credibility problem , a legitimacy problem in international institutions .
Talk about evil prevailing . I mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia .
I want to wrap up , but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio &apos;s life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing , which is how I would have framed the question .
We have reason to be afraid that we haven &apos;t secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union .
And I think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past , know their native languages , the songs , the dances , the traditions , I think part of that reason is because of the remoteness , the span and the wilderness of this almost 95 percent intact ecosystem .
SemCrude , just one of the licensees , in just one of their tailings ponds , dumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day .
But it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca , which feeds these wetlands , and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet , which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream .
Using three iPods like magical props , Marco Tempest spins a clever , surprisingly heartfelt meditation on truth and lies , art and emotion .
MT : This one ?
There are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently .
And that bias is that we &apos;re asking , is this or that &quot; still &quot; ethical ?
A good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying , &quot; In the good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass ?
The secret of happiness is : Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
What &apos;s a meme made of ? What are bits made of , Mom ?
Yesterday , a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out , thanks to all the new technology all over the world .
J.J. from &quot; Good Times , &quot; significant to many people of course because of &quot; Dy-no-mite , &quot; but perhaps more significant as the first , really , black artist on primetime TV .
In 1975 , Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University .
Yochai Benkler explains how collaborative projects like Wikipedia and Linux represent the next stage of human organization .
This is what you &apos;ll find out about Barbie . This is it , there &apos;s nothing more to the definition , including , &quot; manufacturers &quot; -- plural -- &quot; now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls , like this black Barbie . &quot; Which is vastly better than what you &apos;ll find in the encyclopedia.com , which is Barbie , Klaus .
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time .
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game , went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
And raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans .
Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at CalTech in the &apos; 60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior .
So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder .
And so thinking back , I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects .
So you can try to get approval , or not , for whatever you &apos;re wearing .
This next project , we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London .
So we &apos;re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .
She walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the African savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . I jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag .
They have no education and no freedom .
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya .
I want to make this world good .
I &apos;m going to show you something pretty unique .
School &apos;s almost over . Summer is near .
Now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights .
So we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . We figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
It was down to just the two of us , and we were about to go under .
Only , I believe , for a lack of imagination .
&quot; Okay , what about the FBI ? &quot;
So let me show you how this works .
Well , you can play the tracker for a fool , pretending to be at work when you &apos;re really on vacation .
And he was beaten , starved , tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison .
And Moi is 35 years old .
So , one thing we did five years ago : we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States .
We can use a mosquito &apos;s own instincts against her . At TEDxMaastricht speaker Bart Knols demos the imaginative solutions his team is developing to fight malaria -- including limburger cheese and a deadly pill . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
In fact , it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we &apos;re using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans .
Just kidding , just kidding .
From 12 : 00 p.m. to 3 : 00 p.m. , I taught my intro class , 3 : 00 p.m. to 6 : 00 p.m. , I taught my advanced class .
I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And the reason their information has any value is , well , because no one else has access to it .
So how many hours of the day does that take ?
Anybody can play in the game .
Indeed , with the 2008 financial crisis , many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power .
Why does it matter ? Who cares ?
So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody , and it &apos;s not a zero sum , I win , you lose .
It &apos;s how we &apos;ve built it that &apos;s really unique .
It &apos;s true . Ninety percent of children do play video games .
So we &apos;re actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
Yellow or blue ? Blue . We have some people that are serious out there . Yeah .
And one more step is to do training studies .
SW : Yeah .
SW : Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin , and Einstein can sing along with some opera ?
Well , before we wrap it up , she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo .
SW : Good job . Thank you all .
In other words , if you don &apos;t really invest in the human capital , the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster .
For some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money , lack of priorities , because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required .
It &apos;s also related to the way that we subsidize our people , and all the left and right arguments that we have .
Now why does this matter to you ?
After a few years , they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe .
You can see on a graph , after years of stagnation , the paper started to grow , just after redesign .
I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
That chicken wing changed my life .
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
Also around this time , at home , this was the computer that people were buying .
It grows every year .
And the people that went there absolutely loved it .
When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo , whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me .
I , however , have a problem very close to home .
Who is that going to come from ?
That was a great day for my mother .
Look here , two generations ago in Sweden -- picking water from the stream , heating with firewood and washing like that .
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light .
And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot;
If you were to go out there today , 20 years after this fishery collapsed , if you could catch a fish , which would be a bit of a challenge , it would be half that size still .
And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics , or sound waves .
That &apos;s the warm colors which show a well-sampled region .
One of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types .
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following . We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers : hills of Afghanistan , Iraq ...
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA , and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional .
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design , and we &apos;d have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make -- you can always get three out of four of anything you want ; the weight , the size , the cost , the functionality -- I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said , &quot; We &apos;re flying down to Walter Reed , and we &apos;re going talk to these kids , because frankly it doesn &apos;t matter whether we like this arm .
They &apos;re not finished giving yet . &quot;
This is not a happy thing . Look , if this happens to you , I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment . &quot;
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .
He beat someone up or something , and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence .
And they didn &apos;t send him to some cushy hospital .
He was a psychopath .
Now Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies .
And we stitch them together like medieval monks .
But the gray areas are where you find the complexity , it &apos;s where you find the humanity and it &apos;s where you find the truth .
That &apos;s why in June of this year , we passed , as a species , 51 percent of us living in cities , and bustees , and slums , and shantytowns .
Let &apos;s go up and take a look at the Himalayas .
All throughout the technology world , we &apos;re seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .
In a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox -- and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch .
You &apos;ll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group .
When you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
What is the life of the owner of this mouth ? In what society &#91; does &#93; this guy live ?
You know , we mutate during four billion years before , but now , because it &apos;s me , we stop . Fin .
It &apos;s called schizophrenia , and you are dead also .
This scenario , of this civilization , was about becoming powerful , intelligent , like this idea we have invented , this concept of God .
Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day .
The universe is really big .
There is something that made it that way .
The reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before .
It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
If our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it .
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
And I really say , &quot; No . &quot; I mean , women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn &apos;t they ? However , this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males : in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues . They can match the hat .
And I tried , and I made it .
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you , that means we did the right job .
So this is Anatomage Table . Thank you .
You know , if you &apos;re just sleeping with somebody casually , you don &apos;t really care if they &apos;re sleeping with somebody else .
In over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community .
And what I really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving towards a collaborative society , a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed .
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .
I want to end with a story . And then , just a comment .
Thank you .
I wanted it to be more like war photography , where I was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .
But the one thing I definitely didn &apos;t want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters .
But what they can &apos;t deal with is anthropogenic stresses , human things , like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net .
For example , these fish predate on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form .
I &apos;m just saying .
Today , we don &apos;t talk about flying transonically , or even supersonically , we talk about flying hypersonically -- not Mach 2 or Mach 3 , Mach 20 .
But there &apos;s no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly .
Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
We think someone else , someone smarter than us , someone more capable , someone with more resources will solve that problem .
We &apos;ve got to fly it first .
I work with some of the most amazing people .
I came up with this idea : a life of bits and pieces , which I &apos;m just starting to work on -- my next project .
They are cells in dishes and animal testing .
We have three fluidic channels .
It &apos;s really debilitating , and there aren &apos;t really many good treatments for it .
And this is key to the potential of that technology .
We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire .
Makers are in control .
And this kind of gets to this important idea today .
We just had an issue on space exploration , DIY space exploration .
The devil is in me , Court .
Boy : My fuckin &apos; reality .
And that was something that I went through , you know , and I &apos;m still going through .
Witness : We walked and walked for two days .
We don &apos;t need no more ... Committee Chairman : We hope that , with your help and the help of others , that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war .
N In the process of my research , I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this .
When we were working on the Eden Project , we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular , but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried .
So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model , and it created more value in the process .
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions , and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills , and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through , it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .
And then after that , there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract , like phosphates , that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them .
2006 was a great year .
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to ?
So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
And it &apos;s a great story , because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport , and he was welcomed by a non-profit group , which I &apos;m sure someone in this room runs .
You can sleep in clean sheets .
Now is my book the next great American novel ?
So Bertie County is not only very rural ; it &apos;s incredibly poor .
We now call this place home .
So this is Mr. Perry . He &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
This is Ryan .
A scrambled egg is mush -- tasty mush -- but it &apos;s mush .
And it &apos;s expanding at incredible speed .
I &apos;m talking , of course , about living organisms .
As it copies itself , once in every billion rungs , there tends to be an error .
Human societies got larger , denser , more interconnected .
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
The printer lost the file , didn &apos;t tell us .
And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover , and she hides behind a trash bin , in her high heels and her miniskirt .
So we learn a lot from war , and I mention Rwanda because it is one place , like South Africa , where nearly 20 years on , there is healing .
Arthur Benjamin : A performance of &quot; Mathemagic &quot;
Audience : 37 .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one .
Seven ? Seven ?
OK , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
1824 , OK .
I store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene ?
It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do .
Once we become convinced of something , it &apos;s very difficult to change our mind .
We wouldn &apos;t make a physical injury worse on purpose .
A hundred years ago , people began practicing personal hygiene , and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades .
Every street is generally perceived as a straight line , and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make .
So when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago , I tried to make sense of that , because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far .
I think it tries to be the best balance between actual representation and simplification , the language of way-finding in our brain .
This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for .
So bring it on , Walmart , with 100,000 different products , and Amazon , with 27 million books and Match.com with -- what is it ? -- 15 million date possibilities now .
Instead of making better choices , we become overwhelmed by choice , sometimes even afraid of it .
But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision , they all said , &quot; No . &quot;
And I can &apos;t decide .
But all of these attempts have one thing in common .
But you see , there &apos;s an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007 .
Taylor Wilson : My radical plan for small nuclear fission reactors
So it &apos;s a molten salt reactor . It has a core , and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt , the radioactive salt , to a cold salt which isn &apos;t radioactive .
It &apos;s a way to bring power to the developing world , because it &apos;s produced in a factory and it &apos;s cheap .
Well , we certainly try .
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .
It goes to the nucleus accumbens , all the way up to the prefrontal cortex , orbital frontal cortex , where decisions are made , high level .
They &apos;re not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out , or thinking about themselves .
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that as people rise above their biological needs , as the world becomes safer and we don &apos;t have to worry about basic needs being met -- our biological system , whatever motivates us , is being satisfied -- we can rise above them , to think beyond ourselves toward self-actualization or transcendence , and rise above the materialist .
Inside your heart a voice is calling .
But at the other hand , a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions , sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body , fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food .
Each one of these organisms that we &apos;ve described -- that you &apos;ve seen from Jamie and others , these magnificent things -- what they &apos;re doing , each one of them , is they &apos;re hacking the rules of life .
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products .
In fact , you can buy , for 50 bucks , a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago .
Somewhere , today , there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented .
Another example : Have you ever been to Venice ?
&quot; She doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for . &quot;
To ask them to always have the right answer doesn &apos;t allow them to learn .
Technology &apos;s long tail
The DVD , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . But you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
Today it &apos;s less than 50 cents a day .
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive .
This is the size .
Kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they paste them on the school .
But if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ?
And the next behavior I &apos;ll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it .
RF : So if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself .
If we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds .
But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot .
I call this hypersonic sound .
And we &apos;re living in a great time right now , because almost everything &apos;s being explored anew .
Linearity means higher quality sound .
I says , &quot; Why don &apos;t we make an antenna that only exists when you want it ?
And she said , &quot; What on Earth for ? &quot;
But we have to practice .
It &apos;s bottom-up or grassroots power .
We &apos;re getting practical , doable methodologies to answer my question : How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug ?
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child &apos;s personal history .
It &apos;s a sense of knowability , that something is knowable .
So , one of the questions I ask myself is , was this the most distressing TED ever ?
Now , red is Rick Warren , and green is Daniel Dennett , OK ?
Day three .
And as Jay Walker pointed out , that is just not scary enough .
And once you &apos;ve folded it into a paper airplane , I want you to take some anthrax -- and I want you to put that in the paper airplane .
We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world , like Kilimanjaro , Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge .
And apart from a few very important loose ends , which you &apos;ve heard about here -- like dark energy and dark matter -- this equation describes , seems to describe everything about the universe and what &apos;s in it .
It involves gravitational waves .
And in 2001 , I took a research leave to visit them .
Lectures , problem-solving and so on . It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
And he &apos;s shown here with his favorite high school teacher .
And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
And while it &apos;s playing , we can pinch and peak back at the page , and the movie keeps playing .
Picornaviruses -- these are things that include the common cold and polio , things like this .
And so , that &apos;s a hard way to look at things , so I &apos;m just going to encode things as a little barcode , grouped by family , so you can see the results in a very intuitive way .
They got a shot of virus up the nose , let &apos;s see what happens .
That &apos;s the idea , and we &apos;re setting this up in the Bay Area .
No one would even consider it , because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure .
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that &apos;s been linked to cancer .
To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed .
Now , the stakes are very high .
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements .
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment , but he didn &apos;t let go of art . He moved to New York City , and he put together a list of verbs — to roll , to crease , to fold — more than a hundred of them , and as he said , he just started playing around . He did these things to all kinds of material . He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it . He would do the same thing to rubber , and when he got to the direction &quot; to lift , &quot; he created this , which is in the Museum of Modern Art .
Creativity is essential to all of us , whether we &apos;re scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
Well , this map in the sort of redder , yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery .
And we &apos;re also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities .
It &apos;s a horrible situation .
They take their kids out of the workplace , they build a school , they say , &quot; We &apos;re going to have stuff we &apos;ve never had before like three squares , medicine when we &apos;re sick , clothing when we &apos;re cold . &quot;
And so we were rowing , and one of these Western Grebes came along .
And , in fact , there is a product called TPA that &apos;s mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein -- and it &apos;s an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes .
It gives it information . By adding information to matter , it gives it a function that &apos;s different than without that structure .
A guy named Geoff Coates , at Cornell , said to himself , you know , plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time .
That little guy over there is a tardigrade .
That &apos;s the twelfth one .
One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
And what they built was eBox .
It &apos;s the fifth time I stand on this shore , the Cuban shore , looking out at that distant horizon , believing , again , that I &apos;m going to make it all the way across that vast , dangerous wilderness of an ocean .
None of us ever get through this life without heartache , without turmoil , and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a great human quality , you find your way , and Bonnie grabbed my shoulders , and she said , &quot; Let &apos;s find our way to Florida . &quot;
And now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
All of that &apos;s great , and I don &apos;t denigrate it .
If you use it during sex , trying to be politically correct , &quot; Darling , would you stroke my vagina , &quot; you kill the act right there .
And so in 1997 , I said , &quot; Let &apos;s get women together .
Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala .
And in the Masai community , goats and cows are the most valued possession .
So , this arc of the cosmic transformation of God &apos;s favorite angel into the Devil , for me , sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good , ordinary people into perpetrators of evil .
In any event , here &apos;s former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld .
500 New Haven , Connecticut , 500 Bridgeport .
And it &apos;s like a dial on human nature .
They begin to do degrading activities , like having them simulate sodomy .
If you give people power without oversight , it &apos;s a prescription for abuse . They knew that , and let that happen .
I just came to my senses , obviously .
Let &apos;s oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad , and let &apos;s focus on the positive .
We &apos;re just building this stuff . Somebody else is using it . &quot;
You feel good when you do something right , you feel bad when you do something wrong .
They all have two-ness in them .
Let &apos;s take an example .
We &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
And when you think in that way , you become more sensitive to the human considerations , which are crucial to making ethical decisions .
This is what keeps its promise .
What I &apos;d like to do is show you a few of the things that they &apos;re learning .
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog .
It &apos;s breathable . It creates color through structure .
We &apos;re looking at building whole cities in their planning department .
Now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don &apos;t consciously control , like digestion , heart rate and sexual arousal .
Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs .
And apparently the royal court physician said to her , &quot; I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse . &quot;
It all looks very innocent .
Sadly , this device has been dismantled .
And I want to tell you that this is my story , OK ?
My father , who I &apos;ve been talking about , died of AIDS in 1999 .
And you didn &apos;t know about the windmill , you know ?
The continent needs you .
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge .
And he said , &quot; Look , you can get into Harvard , you &apos;re that good , OK ?
This adds together four different waves .
Do you think you &apos;re designing one thing , and then when it &apos;s produced it looks like something else ?
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well .
So , I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra .
Actually , the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept , seventh century A.D. , by the Indians .
Let &apos;s see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle , one after the other .
And although these walls look very different , Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same .
You &apos;ve overestimated .
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it &apos;s all about sex tips .
It may be to illuminate the star ; it may be to sell a film .
And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .
But there &apos;s always this illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without cords .
Is it something important ?
Sometimes under those hats there &apos;s a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow . &quot;
So we got out and walked , and sure enough , about half a mile , we came over the crest of this hill , and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels .
When they &apos;re in rut -- they &apos;re similar to seals in the way , like , a seal has to open its nose to breathe .
But now , we &apos;re going to meet -- out ! Out !
Ogden Nash once wrote : &quot; the camel has a single hump ; the dromedary two , or else the other way around . I &apos;m never sure . Are you ? &quot;
But we see the results of this technology , still .
So if we think about this unleashing human potential , which was possible by cooking and food , why do we talk so badly about food ?
And as I say , energy was necessary .
The lower layer , our gut brain , has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors .
So what we have actually , it &apos;s not an omnivore &apos;s dilemma .
Think about that when you see that building , that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished .
Shamsul Wares : It was almost impossible , building for a country like ours .
I &apos;d been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then I heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it .
Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
This plant is called the Welwitschia , and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola , where it &apos;s uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea .
You &apos;ll see also , there &apos;s a flag on Antarctica .
So what they do is they put gelatin back in , in order to retain the texture .
The low-tech bit is that it &apos;s literally a pig &apos;s heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit , which is a memory metal casing .
Power was focused at the very top .
I think citizens of high-tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons , and the reason can be summed up in one word : data .
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
The same , I felt , was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to , and to some extent the same is true of us .
In Britain , it could mean looking to the French , learning from the French , getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system .
We know now that they &apos;re capable of imitating behaviors that they see .
What &apos;s happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages , instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way , many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program , it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages .
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa , the droughts are so much worse .
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves .
And animals , almost on the brink of extinction , can be given a second chance . That &apos;s my next book .
And he &apos;s a Swiss engineer , Carl .
So in the years leading up to the Second World War , the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $ 14,000 each -- again , in 1940 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
Well it turns out that Carl Norden , as a proper Swiss , was very enamored of German engineers .
95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed , right ?
So if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . It peaks in early adolescence .
In other words , everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence , whereas in contrast , if you look at the last two gray bars , there &apos;s still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood , and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else &apos;s perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior , which is something , by the way , that we do in everyday life all the time , is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence .
You guys have very insecure computers , OK ?
And if it &apos;s the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic . Thank you very much .
Second , instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state , why don &apos;t we simplify and say , what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform ?
But , particularly , what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work .
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan , 86 percent of the women , listen to at least three radio stations a day .
And what I will say here is that aid doesn &apos;t work .
So I have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from Iran &apos;s border to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor .
And I &apos;m in the meeting -- it &apos;s about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in , there kind of needs to be that bio break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed .
Don &apos;t you love that kind of thing from college ?
And she &apos;s an operator in a company in Silicon Valley , and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist .
I think , as a society , we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls .
I have two children .
But in 1492 , two important things happen .
But this is not about religion , it &apos;s not about proselytizing .
And I think I scared him -- because he basically promised me -- we had no product -- but he said , &quot; We &apos;ll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you &apos;ll just go away . &quot;
I can &apos;t forget auntie .
The first one , they said Saudi Arabia . There was no debate .
Thank you very much .
Are the premises warranted ? Are the inferences valid ?
And I say , &quot; Well why do you believe P ? &quot;
All these different roles . Now , can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer , but you &apos;re also in the audience watching yourself argue ?
And I &apos;d go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house , which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood .
In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
At TED2012 , filmmaker Karen Bass shares some of the astonishing nature footage she &apos;s shot for the BBC and National Geographic -- including brand-new , previously unseen footage of the tube-lipped nectar bat , who feeds in a rather unusual way …
The cloud lifted , the wind was still , and even the bear showed up .
But just looking up with the naked eye , you really don &apos;t need one .
If you &apos;re a mammal , if you &apos;re a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it &apos;s the same story .
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
Now , this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years .
What are the things that they all do ?
Instead , if your friend &apos;s idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they &apos;re engaged , and they &apos;re trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time .
It &apos;s actually Bitcoin .
You know , reputations are built on trust , consistency , transparency .
And you can &apos;t come into this . This is purely for the community that are sweating using Nike products . You can &apos;t buy stuff with pesos .
But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , I realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
And you can use passive energy -- so heat , shaking , pneumatics , gravity , magnetics .
I &apos;m biased .
It has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs .
So I guess it &apos;s a world premier .
It &apos;s not just what you see in picture .
I just can &apos;t tell you -- there &apos;s one thing I want to tell you .
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people &apos;s face , that &apos;s Nollywood .
So on the streets , are film casts ... ?
I gave myself the problem .
What would I love ?
And when I had this thought , I was imagining that I would make -- I would have a whole machine theater evening , where I would -- you would have an audience , the curtain would open , and you &apos;d be entertained by machines on stage .
To my surprise , it did not correlate .
To the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl , who is not very tall .
So then I measured , and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced , but correct usage -- words like exit , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations .
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .
So I thought I &apos;d give it a name -- why don &apos;t we call it &quot; outdoctrination . &quot;
That &apos;s not the methodology at all that we work with .
Okay , you &apos;ve got something ? One more thing .
We &apos;ve got mental architecture , we &apos;re sharing it , therefore solving a problem . They &apos;re enacting it .
Here we go . Catarina , big moment , here we go , one .
Put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .
I strive for authenticity , even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect .
In an even more radical stance against consumerism , the company placed a &quot; Don &apos;t Buy This Jacket &quot; advertisement during the peak of shopping season .
I work in global poverty .
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors .
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years , and when we get it back , we invest in other innovations that focus on change .
And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges , the first child to desegregate schools in the South -- in this case , New Orleans .
So , let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it .
So , when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish , we got a mass of blue cells .
I said , if it &apos;s true that architecture is dominant , architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it &apos;s normal .
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions .
Why don &apos;t we start there ?
So this was like , &quot; Here we go -- let &apos;s start on this trip . &quot;
The Paralympics , just for a little bit of clarification , are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees , persons with cerebral palsy , and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics , which deals with people with mental disabilities .
And , you know , I was the only female U.S. sprinter .
OK , now , these are my sprinting legs , made of carbon graphite , like I said , and I &apos;ve got to make sure I &apos;ve got the right socket .
And , I mean , it &apos;s really -- let me take this off so you can see it .
There &apos;s no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
James Howard Kunstler : The ghastly tragedy of the suburbs
And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq , spilling their blood in the sand , and ask yourself , &quot; What is their last thought of home ? &quot;
It was : &quot; Fuck it . &quot;
But what happens is , of course , it mutates over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather insidious .
We &apos;re going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of !
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending .
But you &apos;ll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO &apos;s argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ?
We &apos;ll use biofuels . Problem solved .
Bottom left , well , there &apos;s no one .
Of course , Britain doesn &apos;t have any deserts .
Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain , and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating .
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi , 14 years ago .
&#91; &quot; Hole in the wall film - 1999 &quot; &#93; An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do .
So I said , &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot;
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete .
SM : So what &apos;s happening here ?
My wish is that we design the future of learning .
Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we &apos;re still around , I can &apos;t imagine the world not being populated with robots .
Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism , actually ; the intelligence on board was fairly simple .
And I want to actually use a robot here -- a robot named Chris -- stand up . Yeah . Okay .
And it gets bored , so it will then look away at something else .
It was just saying random English phonemes .
They want to take over from us .
And obviously there &apos;s been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox , the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus .
Daniel Tammet : Different ways of knowing
It &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
Some people say it &apos;s happy .
Well , here &apos;s an example from my own experience .
And I won &apos;t go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it &apos;s like , and so on .
So we say , in general , that there &apos;s a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon , or its description , unchanged .
One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today , but in his day it wasn &apos;t taken for granted .
It &apos;s my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means I collect dead animals .
And the Ig Nobel Prize — — the Ig Nobel Prize honors research that first makes people laugh , and then makes them think , with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science .
It took all day , and the prisoners had a great time .
So in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact , it &apos;s actually a massage chair .
Mark &apos;s going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
In the fashion industry , there &apos;s very little intellectual property protection .
And they &apos;ve been faced with a lot of lawsuits , but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers .
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy , and that &apos;s what fashion designers are doing all the time .
You know , it &apos;s not just the fashion industry that doesn &apos;t have copyright protection .
Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea : something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?
We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -- lights that can allow us to see what we currently don &apos;t see .
The main part of it is the blue part , polycation , and it &apos;s basically very sticky to every tissue in your body .
So if you &apos;re driving on the freeway and you want to know where &apos;s the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
And he brought his whole team with him .
I &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary . &quot;
And then he compared that to friendship , when two people stand side by side , as it were , shoulder to shoulder , with their eyes fixed on a common goal .
Armstrong O &apos;Brian , Jr. shared it with three other men .
He &apos;s got a fence ; he scavenged a door ; he &apos;s got new tile on the roof .
People burn trash to get rid of the garbage , and they dig their own sewer channels .
Thank you very much .
And you get a far lower risk of famine , because you actually had two crops to fall back on , not one .
Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people &apos;s behavior .
In the world of food we call it cooking .
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape .
Diane Benscoter : How cults rewire the brain
This is the leg of a suicide bomber .
While I was preparing my dog for the run , a man was finishing drinking at a bar , picked up his car keys , got into a car and headed south , or wherever he was .
So they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart , and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado .
They were going to make it fun for me .
But when I looked down , I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up , so I got going on it .
If religion is the opium of the masses , then for me , music is my one and only ganja .
I went back to South Carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the 1960s , with the reckless condescension of that era thinking I would save my people .
&quot; Good . Buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there . &quot;
Whenever you hear this , I will be there . &quot;
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians -- Robicsek , Teszler and Bartok -- as it does my own .
So here &apos;s a new definition for doodling .
And what is the definition then ? &quot; The definition ?
But if I would change this axis here , I would instead put income per person .
And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
And on this axis , GDP .
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this .
But then they started to grow their economy .
So to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
We the children had gathered at a friend &apos;s house .
He said that his vote was in his heart .
And guess what , it worked .
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated , slowly and painfully .
After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia , I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization .
At the time I was photographing in these different places , I thought I was covering separate stories , but on 9 / 11 history crystallized , and I understood I &apos;d actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years , and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation .
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote .
You know , I &apos;m doing some research in my lab with a video camera , and within the first week , a million people had seen this work , and literally within days , engineers , teachers and students from around the world , were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work .
This bush here is known as baume de l &apos;ile plate in the local vernacular .
Now , this plant here has developed remarkable tolerance to drought , which enables it to withstand up to 98 percent dehydration over the period of a year without damage , and yet it can regenerate itself almost completely overnight , over 24 hours , and flower .
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
You put them in a new car , and after a few laps , they &apos;ve found the fastest line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the races .
In fact , entirely reflexive .
She &apos;s one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that I support .
It &apos;s still sort of locked away in the banking system today .
To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years , Print Aid would have generated 200 billion dollars &apos; worth of extra aid .
But what we &apos;re going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory , mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures , and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems .
This structure , then , can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself , so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself , and that &apos;s shown in green here on this micrograph .
So , I added these protocells together to the system , and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB .
Basically what that means is , you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself .
Melanie is the wife of Albert .
We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
I went in and I took them .
Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot;
Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines , they &apos;re called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size .
I have another piece that I &apos;d like to play for you .
I have here seven note cards , one with each note of the musical alphabet , and I &apos;d like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I &apos;ll improvise it .
It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard . And &quot; God &quot; ?
Dan Cobley : What physics taught me about marketing
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it .
Todd Kuiken : A prosthetic arm that &quot; feels &quot;
Well how about with higher levels of amputation ?
So this is the first man that we tried it on .
Imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin .
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high .
If it stops working for some reason , I can retrain it .
We want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the EMG signals , so that it &apos;s not worrying about electrode contact .
And most folks don &apos;t even know they exist .
And that , my friends , is how we can make a difference one kid at a time .
So we feel that we &apos;ve formed a successful online community with girls .
Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
Rockett : It &apos;s like I &apos;m just waking up , you know ?
For me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives .
However , after a few failed prototypes , I finally came up with this , the Lifesaver bottle .
Replace the top .
All we &apos;ve go to do is make it sterile . How do we do that ?
&quot; Just a one-eyed monkey , &quot; said the Brahmin .
It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws &apos; families .
I will tell all of you . Just wait .
It &apos;s that little gene . It &apos;s small and it &apos;s mean .
But the princess continued whistling .
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex , rich and yet totally rational : it &apos;s an instrument -- had something to do with science , and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that .
And they shelved the project . And it sat there for 10 years , and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles , who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz , came , saw the model , wrote the check and it got built 10 years later .
And all the galleries , as you move through them and so on , are below grade .
Patrick Chappatte : The power of cartoons
And as he came the second day , I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really a cartoon lover . &quot;
In 2006 , a few months after , I went Ivory Coast -- Western Africa .
And cartoons can cross boundaries , as you have seen .
If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
And I &apos;ve got to tell you , I wasn &apos;t that hopeful , because I &apos;d seen the establishment . I thought , it always sticks together . I am out of luck .
So that &apos;s open-source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law .
And if you don &apos;t have skepticism and humility , then it &apos;s a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat , and I think you only have to read &quot; Animal Farm &quot; to get that message about how power corrupts people .
So there &apos;s all of this complexity in our natural systems , but they &apos;re extremely efficient , far more efficient than anything we can build , far more complex than anything we can build .
On the right-hand side , &#91; 0,0 &#93; input is a 1 output , which goes up .
If you want the really big numbers , look at these numbers for heart disease .
This is obviously not one of them .
The tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier , long before the symptoms emerge .
I want to remind you again -- I know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors , the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives ?
So I was the oldest person in the house .
So even from an economic standpoint , if we leave the social and the humanitarian , we need to save lives now .
Now , who are they accountable to ?
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that , you know , these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources .
So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs .
I &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
Now , what good is it to have that ?
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well .
Now compare that with real price increments .
This comes out . This comes out .
And I work in design .
You see , there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power , displacing the need for fossil fuel power , but we need to be smart about this .
But essentially , this is a big problem .
And this guy over here , though , he does . He &apos;s named Simon .
But design is one of the best solutions .
All right , so it &apos;s a delicate dance .
It usually begins here , and it grows and then it falls .
And , I noticed that most inventions fail , not because the R &amp; amp ; D department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the timing is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation .
And we can predict these trends far into the future .
It &apos;s now under a 10th of a cent .
We &apos;ve already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred .
And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives , from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials .
But , to cut a long story short , I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist .
When I went , I saw the ghastliest thing ever .
This is a fashion show we held in London .
So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it .
But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut , because I was painting it from my gut .
But I &apos;m not . I &apos;m capable of thinking anything .
But it was earlier this year , when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization .
He takes the uniform off . He &apos;s no longer Sergeant Jones in his community . He &apos;s now Dave from Kansas City .
&quot; Come on . This is our opportunity . &quot;
How amazing is that ? How often in life do you get to make friendships , judgment-free , purely based on spirit ?
They told me , &quot; We &apos;re going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . &quot;
It was beautiful . They lifted me into the cockpit .
Why not learn to fly upside down ? &quot;
&quot; And what do you mean with Western world ? &quot; I said .
And on top of that , we can put East Europe , we can put East Asia , and we put South Asia . And how did it look like if we go back in time , to about 1970 ? Then there was more of a hump .
They came from here , a mineral country . They cached all the oil ; they got all the money ; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket .
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
And watch that beginning to happen .
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War .
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country , I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country , who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7 / 7 bombings .
As other speakers have said , it &apos;s a rather daunting experience -- a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience .
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world , and how we react to that , and how well we do or don &apos;t think about it .
It takes longer , on average .
When you look at DNA , there &apos;s a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails -- but four letters -- As , Gs , Cs and Ts .
Don &apos;t think you don &apos;t trust me anymore .
So where did he get the one in 73 million number ?
So the chance that she &apos;s innocent isn &apos;t one in 73 million .
It &apos;s all very well to say , &quot; Let &apos;s do our best to present the evidence . &quot;
I &apos;m a cancer doctor , and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago , and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy .
But , if we start to understand that cancer isn &apos;t just a molecular defect , it &apos;s something more , then we &apos;ll get to new ways of treating it , as I &apos;ll show you .
But , as a cancer doc , this is what I see .
So , the states , are equivalent classes of history , and the cancer patient , the input , is the environment , the diet , the treatment , the genetic mutations .
And I &apos;m sorry if you can &apos;t read the numbers , they &apos;re kind of small .
If we slow the disease , we may have more of a benefit on patient survival , patient outcome , how they feel , than if we shrink the disease .
And I &apos;m a firm believer , in the field of medicine and especially cancer , that it &apos;s going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near-term .
She has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one-woman show .
You know , it &apos;s heartening to me .
I like that .
The teacher , Herr Schtopf , he never discriminated .
But first , she said she &apos;s not interested .
And when I touch you , I feel happy inside .
So it &apos;s a real-time thing . It &apos;s much quicker . It &apos;s happening on a constant basis , and the journalist is always playing catch up .
And a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011 .
Sometimes the search for truth , though , is a little bit less flippant , and it has much greater consequences .
But what it tells me is that , at a time when there &apos;s more -- there &apos;s a greater abundance of information than there ever has been , it &apos;s harder to filter , we have greater tools .
But nature had its wicked way , and brown babies were born .
So in Africa , there &apos;s been more time to create genetic diversity . &quot;
I give it its due .

My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust , and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don &apos;t have anything in their libraries , and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , in reading and writing , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
It &apos;s my one way of getting rid of my mind , getting rid of this mind that says , &quot; Hey , you know what you &apos;re doing . You know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
In Delhi , we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota .
I exist because there are stories , and if there are no stories , we don &apos;t exist .
I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film .
Go .
So , in my mind , in the future , they started to build flyovers .
Resolution is something that is far more limited .
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list .
And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way .
So this is the signature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
And so those tumors , those are symptoms of cancer .
There will be many teams like our team that work on this .
But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there , and see what would happen inside there .
It wasn &apos;t like a TED conference .
In fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag -- some of you , I know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags -- but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s got to do with rockets or it wouldn &apos;t be in that manual .
But I knew , you &apos;d go into the lab and you &apos;d try to make it work yourself . And then you &apos;re the authority , and you can say , I know it works , because right there in that tube is where it happened , and here , on this gel , there &apos;s a little band there that I know that &apos;s DNA , and that &apos;s the DNA I wanted to amplify , so there ! So it does work .
And most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that .
I &apos;ll stand up too , and -- They have to say that .
But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music .
&#91; But now &#93; he was ready to tell .
We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day , June 17 , when women go out and drive .
&quot; Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign . &quot;
A friend once asked me , she said , &quot; So when do you think this women driving will happen ? &quot;
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this , and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find .
And I thought , &quot; My God , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
And this is what they were building .
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the villas .
That condition &apos;s going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want , which is , you know , 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities .
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships .
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text , and the text is blasted all over .
That would be fantastic . So those are my three wishes .
This is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-trillion-a-year discontinuity in the global economy .
Why ? Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read .
White is the synthesis .
It &apos;s been 110 years since Georges Méliès sent a spaceship slamming into the eye of the man on the moon . So how far have visual effects come since then ? Working closely with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , Don Levy takes us on a visual journey through special effects , from the fakery of early technology to the seamless marvels of modern filmmaking .
And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , I did the only thing I could think of at the time .
It &apos;s tedious .
This is a Klein bottle .
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . Pretty good .
So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
So the next time you get dengue fever , if it &apos;s a different strain , you &apos;re more susceptible , you &apos;re likely to get worse symptoms , and you &apos;re more likely to get the more severe forms , hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome .
Clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
And then we &apos;ve gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits .
Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the &quot; Dragonball Z : Android Saga . &quot;
This experiment revealed the first , and perhaps most fundamental , nugget of the neural code : that information is written in the form of electrical impulses .
She cut the heads off of her flies .
What &apos;s common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine .
Richard Branson : Life at 30,000 feet
Post-Napster , you &apos;re looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well .
What was that one ?
RB : Philippe is quite erratic , so I think that he wouldn &apos;t be the best person to design the engine , no .
And cynics might say , you know , this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing .
But is there a risk here ?
Is any of it true ? Is there an element of truth in it ?
It &apos;s important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years .
That &apos;s a thing . Google it .
Drown out the negative with the positive .
Where did this guy get this confidence , the audacity of it ?
About the size of the Great Wall of China , this would hardly be an invisible structure .
But , how far away is it ?
What happens is , you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand , and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains .
It &apos;s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
And that &apos;s what he did .
And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena .
Remember Prickly Pear .
I &apos;ve been leading polar expeditions for most of my adult life , and last month , my teammate Tarka L &apos;Herpiniere and I finished the most ambitious expedition I &apos;ve ever attempted .
It was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since 1912 .
High on the Antarctic plateau , over 10,000 feet , it &apos;s very windy , very cold , very dry , we were exhausted .
One of Shackleton &apos;s men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station .
If you look close , it &apos;s this shape , called a crane .
But if we follow the laws of origami , we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very , very simple , but when we put it together , we get something a little different .
There are other dimensions for flaps .
And you can do more than just insects .
Whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ? You &apos;ve got to get it up there in a rocket .
And as weird and surprising as it may sound , origami may someday even save a life .
The test was : from the moment they got together , how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word &quot; you &quot; in it .
There &apos;s a company , Bennett and Company , that supplies Polo.com , Victoria &apos;s Secret -- they , because of their CEO , who &apos;s aware of this , in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater .
The robot I &apos;m holding in my hand is this one , and it &apos;s been created by two students , Alex and Daniel .
You can send them inside buildings like this as first responders to look for intruders , maybe look for biochemical leaks , gaseous leaks .
So I want change gears .
Another application I want to show you -- again , this is in our lab .
And of course , it &apos;s made exclusively for TED 2012 .
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .
So I &apos;ll give you an example of wise practice in action .
Now consider Ms. Dewey .
And so what they do is they follow the scripts , but they follow the scripts at double-time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective .
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients .
That is in addition to left , right , back , forth and up , down , Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don &apos;t yet see .
So Kaluza says , maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves .
In detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory .
Now you might think about that and say , well , OK , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough .
And we think -- and this is , I think , very exciting -- that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
There is the law in Leviticus , &quot; You cannot shave the corners of your beard . &quot;
He was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .

This was just installed last month .
They used to get great apartments in the center of town , casual sex on tap , and they could travel to the West very freely , which was a great luxury at the time .
And why is it ? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region .
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now .
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came .
And you say , boy , that &apos;s a lot .
Now that &apos;s a lot of money .
We can &apos;t grow our business unless we solve these problems .
We went to them and they said , &quot; Look , could you help us ? &quot;
Of course , it must be American cola .
And the best teachers were the girls , not the boys , and they were terrific .
According to the U.N. , new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent , and according to the World Bank , 7.7 million lives were saved .
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development .
And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like .
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it &apos;s wrapped around these purple proteins -- or I &apos;ve labeled them purple here .
It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it &apos;s ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
In the medical context that it comes from , it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment .
He says that he &apos;s just at an extreme end of the spectrum we &apos;re all on .
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .
So , I &apos;m going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit .
And we found through this whole process , we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia , and if his body language is any indication , that &apos;s the owner — — of what it &apos;s like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer , you &apos;ve got to see what happens here .
Take a look at the second door and see if there &apos;s any different message .
I think you eventually can and , more importantly , I think it &apos;s true .
And then the tiny line of copy says , If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website .
I just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but I don &apos;t know what they are .
And if you wouldn &apos;t , what the heck are you doing ?
In still other fireflies , both sexes use quick , bright flashes to find their mates .
Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out .
Jaime Lerner reinvented urban space in his native Curitiba , Brazil . Along the way , he changed the way city planners worldwide see what &apos;s possible in the metropolitan landscape .
That means mostly two main issues -- mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities .
You should have always a structure of living and working together .
And she said , &quot; Well , I saw you speak , and I &apos;m going to call you a researcher , I think , but I &apos;m afraid if I call you a researcher , no one will come , because they &apos;ll think you &apos;re boring and irrelevant . &quot;
This is what it &apos;s all about .
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness , where I saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
So this is what I learned .
There &apos;s just blame .
Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days , but secretly , I hate him .
Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world , and I had a slide like this , and I switched it every second , it would take up my entire TED talk , and I wouldn &apos;t have to say anything .
It &apos;s just necessary or interesting that it might have one good , unique trait .
And I &apos;m not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys .
Norway owns the mountain and the facility , but the depositors own the seed .
And the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context , break down quickly , and are hard to repair .
So we teamed up with Continuum , a local product design firm here in Boston to make the high-end version , the developed world version , that we &apos;ll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe , but to higher-income buyers .
It &apos;s measuring all sorts of things around the car .
The blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change , and immediately , before we even started putting in clinical interpretation , we can see that the data is speaking to us .
I know you &apos;re there because I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you because I normally wear glasses .
First question : If I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear .
Now , folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation , they call me , they say , &quot; Why are you so concerned about this , Mr. Randi ?
It &apos;s very easy , win the million dollars .
Now that is true . That is what homeopathy is all about .
That &apos;s really sad to hear , and it hasn &apos;t helped them one bit , hasn &apos;t solved any of their problems .
When you look at this orb web , you &apos;re actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
It &apos;s short . And on the bottom , this is the repeat sequence for the egg case , or tubuliform silk protein , for the exact same spider . And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family .
We don &apos;t really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it &apos;s unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile .
He was quite a know-it-all , and he wanted to kind of make you laugh .
Now look at his response .
Milo &apos;s Mom : Oh , you &apos;ve got gravy all over the floor .
Reuse of syringes , all too common in under-funded clinics , kills 1.3 million each year . Marc Koska clues us in to this devastating global problem with facts , photos and hidden-camera footage . He shares his solution : a low-cost syringe that can &apos;t be used twice .
And I think , if I can just borrow this camera , I was going to show you my invention , which I came up with .
This is not a scale model , this is the real size .
You see , we &apos;re going to launch more than 100 of these satellites like these over the course of the next year .
Well , I invite you to come and explore with us .
Over the course of the 24 months , the first two years that we really focused on , this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order .
In this video , again , my son is being traced out .
And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family , we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people .
So I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family .
Sobule : Hillary supported the war . Sweeney : Even Thomas Friedman supported the war . Sobule : Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together : ... such a pussy . Sobule : William Faulkner , drunk and depressed , Tennessee Williams , drunk and depressed . Sweeney : Yeah .
&apos;I failed ! &apos; He cried .
One was -- never be late . Never be late .
They think all change is progress .
Not necessary to what you would want them to be , but they will be about what they should , and only you will know whether you can do that .
Somebody else is in there ahead of them .
For over a decade , the Tahltan people , both clans , Wolf and Crow , have resisted this assault on their homeland .
This is a scientific diagram , by the way .
To say I wonder is to say I question , I ask .
So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them .
But I really believe that a fully operating , rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .
We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation , to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities .
This is Samantha .
Thank you .
So I quit my degree , I headed off to the Himalayas , I became a monk , and I started studying meditation .
If you think about the last time , I dunno , you had a wobbly tooth .
And how big a problem is this ?
And most medical devices , we &apos;ve learned , as we &apos;ve dug in , are really designed for Westerners , for wealthier economies .
And with centralized manufacturing , you can control the quality control , and you can hit that $ 80 price point with profit margins built in .
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
There &apos;s another -- not definition , but description , of hope that has always appealed to me , and it was one by Václav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book &quot; Breaking the Peace , &quot; in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right , but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out .
So , you go back to the old Indo-European root again , and what do you find ? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen -- we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and , lo and behold , mirabile dictu , it is the same root as the word compassion comes from , P-A-E-N .
And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow ?
More than traditional leadership programs , answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st-century leader .
And then , following this advice , we start with this lowly , humble NAND gate , and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set , a hardware platform , an assembler , a virtual machine , a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple , Java-like language that we call &quot; JACK . &quot;
And &#91; Joyce &#93; said that mistakes are the portals of discovery .
I grew up in Mobile , Alabama -- somebody &apos;s got to be from Mobile , right ? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers , forming this beautiful delta .
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , &quot; Wait a minute .
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen , and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen , get in a sub .
There &apos;s no hot water .
And these problems are so large and global , and it &apos;s just overwhelming . &quot;
But it wasn &apos;t enough to use the priests .
Bones were broken . Especially in old , fragile people , you couldn &apos;t use it .
I rarely bathed . I sometimes didn &apos;t shave . It was dreadful .
And he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
I really have it figured out , so that I can advise people about death and dying , so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit .
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
Pat Mitchell : And this is your hospital . This is the inside .
It brought much , much needed medical care to people who wouldn &apos;t get it .
They do everything for them .
This is called &quot; The Dress . &quot;
Too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts .
Her vigil somewhere I know continues .
Died in the camps , that too people -- or Jews anyway -- kept from their children back then .
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology .
High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money .
But what you &apos;ve got to do to get that is you &apos;ve got to go inside the favelas , bring in the basic services -- mainly education and health -- with high quality .
So how &apos;s the weather in Rio now ?
That is fantastic .
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; Probably has something to do with the Americans . &apos; &quot; And I said , &quot; Yeah .
You can find it here : this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon .
And it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
But I can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you &apos;re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that &apos;s where people are , where the cities are , you &apos;re going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
And in fact I would visit friends of mine , and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes .
And so we see that violence is , in a way , behaving like a contagious disease .
And there &apos;s whole industries designed for managing bad people .
And that &apos;s actually a shop in Calcutta , but it &apos;s a place where we like our books .
When I moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
Song : Before God destroyed the people on the Earth , he warned Noah to build an Ark .
He said , &quot; What can I do to save the rainforests ? &quot;
But in general , this is what we &apos;ve got .
All of those things are part of that equation .
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view .
So we &apos;ve started roundtables where we bring together the entire value chain , from producers all the way to the retailers and brands .
Mars is also on a similar journey .
And I go on the podium .
And I think the happiness , the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music .
It &apos;s Mozart as I , Riccardo Muti , understand it . &quot;
Because you didn &apos;t know when to play .
And that &apos;s what makes them into partners .
So that &apos;s a good thing .
And in the same community , this is business synergy .
Big businesses have recognized this , and what &apos;s fascinating about this slide , it &apos;s not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off .
This is a real street sign in Lagos , Nigeria .
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn &apos;t sufficiently recognized , I think .
We don &apos;t see the curvature of space-time , and other universes .
So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest , they &apos;d have known that their theory is false .
One is well known : untestable theories .
These words , I hold onto all my life .
An African shaman said , &quot; Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes . &quot;
Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .

We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
So , it was just before the time that the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met , to New York , to see my new domain .
But for me , they summed up a kind of , that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the 18th century .
And again , going on thinking about this , I realize that in a way we &apos;re all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another , or are deemed to do so .
He &apos;s , I hope , a little bit dignified , but mostly rather vulgar .
And so maybe I &apos;ll build a gilded cage .
It &apos;s a letter from &quot; Artforum &quot; in 1967 saying &quot; We can &apos;t imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art . &quot; And they still haven &apos;t .
And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .
The idea is that basically -- if it &apos;s constantly like &quot; Huh ? ... Huh ? &quot;
Otherwise , I &apos;m going home . &quot;
And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets , aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time .
So I did just that .
At the start , though , I had to memorize the names you give for each color , so I had to memorize the notes , but after some time , all this information became a perception .
It &apos;s not my fault , because — And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color .
So what did they do ?
And here &apos;s a strange thing : Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme , opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them , and they &apos;re building relationships , and because they do that , they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster and seize more opportunities .
Currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
One problem : waste handling and unemployment .
And when we do that , our neighbors -- be they next-door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- will be just fine .
But I did in fact get married in it .
So as of today , it &apos;s finished . I &apos;d like to say that I planned that for TED , but I didn &apos;t . So it &apos;s been completed as of today .
So , 100 billion galaxies , 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey , actually , is about the same as from Monterey to these things .
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field .
And I &apos;d say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis &apos; talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world , to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things .
And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost CAD / CAM prototyping technology .
So these are some that we &apos;ve been asked to think about recently .
And we can take out the physical product , and ready to use , or to , perhaps , assemble into something else .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
But there are more and more technologies , software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers .
What &apos;s more likely , and we &apos;re seeing it today , is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center .
The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes . A little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish .
BR : So you see us here cutting up some watermelon . The idea with this is that we &apos;re going to eliminate tons of food miles , wasted energy , and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna , or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place , with local , organic produce ; so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin .
What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses , who has flaws , who is maybe not immediately likable , but eventually relatable .
But it &apos;s also a morally important one .
Co-creator of the philanthropic FEED bags , Ellen Gustafson says hunger and obesity are two sides of the same coin . In her talk , she launches The 30 Project -- a way to change how we farm and eat in the next 30 years , and solve the global food inequalities behind both epidemics .
So those seem like two bifurcated problems , but I kind of started to think about , you know , what is obesity and hunger ? What are both those things about ?
You know , there &apos;s 30-year cycles .
I design reading programs for preschoolers .
You will need advocates .
And in this movie , we see what we think is out there : flying saucers and aliens .
Now , a lot of you are going to die of old age , but some of you , horribly enough , are going to die in an accident .
And I worked on this Permian extinction , camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time .
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian .
They stop complex life from existing .
Do we all have to have a little button saying , Let me die ?
Plastics cause serious problems , such as the destruction of ecosystems , the pollution of natural resources , and the reduction of available land space .
MW : Okay . Well , it was partially my fault .
On simplicity . What a great way to start .
What if the sky was 41 percent gray ? Wouldn &apos;t that be the perfect sky ? &quot;
And she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school .
This is why they have fireworks in the summer .
If you dry them quick , you can make , like , elephants and steers and stuff , and my wife didn &apos;t like these , because they mold , so I had to stop that .
Because I want to simplify them for you .
They have so many thoughts , and they have so much wisdom , and I think -- you know , this TED thing , I &apos;ve come here .
And the answer was no , which I found in the London Times archive .
When Esta Soler lobbied for a bill outlawing domestic violence in 1984 , one politician called it the &quot; Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act . &quot; &quot; If only I had Twitter then , &quot; she mused . This sweeping , optimistic talk charts 30 years of tactics and technologies -- from the Polaroid camera to social media -- that led to a 64 % drop in domestic violence in the U.S .
And I have to tell you , I &apos;m passionate about data .
And a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said , &quot; You want men to talk about violence against women and girls . Men don &apos;t talk . &quot;
But first , I want to take you on a little journey .
But what &apos;s really interesting is , this water &apos;s got to come from some place , and it comes from here , the Colorado River in North America .
You see the canal they dug ?
This is work that we &apos;re doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment .
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined .
Why are we doing this ?
It had to improve it a little bit .
But it &apos;s a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication , the rules of connectivity , because the neurons don &apos;t just like to connect with any neuron .
We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information , and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other .
I started my journey 30 years ago .
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience , this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation , has got major controversies .
This , of course , is a visual map that I &apos;m showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate .
We have one body , not two , not three .
They &apos;re not there for looks .
Thank you for your attention .
It &apos;s about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I &apos;ll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren &apos;t recognizing .
Third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards .
Children can use it . Adults can use it . Everybody uses it .
As for me , disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth , I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie .
Yes , China is a one-party state run by the Chinese Communist Party , the Party , and they don &apos;t hold elections .
The department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations .
I said , &quot; How about competency ? &quot;
Income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries .
Are you happy with the general direction of the country ?
It &apos;s like a rodeo show . They all get a ride on the machine , and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .
So nice , all week . He &apos;s the kind of man you could say to , &quot; Chris , I &apos;m really sorry , I &apos;ve crashed your car .
&quot; How can your coffee be true ? &quot;
But the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said , &quot; What you as the city of London have done for financial services , we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . &quot;
How many people here are left-handed ?
But at the moment , it &apos;s a Cicero thing .
&quot; I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
In the first phase of this testing , which is called testing for toxicity , it &apos;s called Phase I .
So again , financial engineering was helpful here .
And so we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong .
And also , it was kind of interesting that God needed help .
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is , but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak , Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance .
If anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
And as I look forward to what is next , it &apos;s been helpful to reflect on the things I &apos;ve learned so far .
So they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
Just existing .
I don &apos;t think -- now , this is a worldview , and I will tell you , everybody &apos;s got a worldview .
This is why I believe what I believe . &quot;
But that &apos;s not the good life .
And , by the way , your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth .
So , He &apos;s going , &quot; What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
That , to me , is the primary question about life .
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
Well , most likely it would . It might be able to grow .
Stefan Wolff : The path to ending ethnic conflicts
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story .
Rather , local leaders committed to revisiting them later on .
Thank you .
You know , is it worth trying to get there ?
Everybody thought the answer is , send things to India and China .
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volume isn &apos;t there .
And then , there &apos;s business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
We only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9 / 11 , sort of from 9 / 11 / 2001 . For one week , what did the world see ?
It could be something that we &apos;re remembered for , for millennia , for having achieved .
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel .
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect , more aware , more noble and more just society .
Same with this -- it &apos;s a movie review , an art review , a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go .
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery .
You could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gut , on the liver , on the heart , on the brain .
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart without cracking the chest .
But it &apos;s all coming in through one incision .
These maladies come for us all .
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside . &quot;
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening : wildlife disappearing , poaching was skyrocketing , and the situation seemed very hopeless .
And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative , through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up-to-date conservation practices .
Janette Sadik-Khan : New York &apos;s streets ? Not so mean any more
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space .
And that &apos;s twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood .
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes .
We overestimate our longevity , our career prospects .
We can &apos;t all be better than everyone else .
It &apos;s a really curious fact , because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure , so you &apos;d assume that people will prefer Sunday , but they don &apos;t .
So they learned quickly and efficiently .
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves , would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits ?
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult , to actually try and build this kind of thing .
In fact , Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early &apos; 90s today : everybody &apos;s very excited , there &apos;s a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment , and then there &apos;s despair and everybody thinks the whole thing &apos;s not going to work .
And I think that &apos;s something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know , that 3D , that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective , and it was just absolutely never used , and we ultimately -- I think we &apos;ve now turned it off , if I remember .
JH : And your question ?
So I did , kind of , I think , live in my own world , and obviously that helps , you know , engage your real interest in something .
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial , and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape , the rape victim got on the stand and said , &quot; I &apos;m absolutely positive that &apos;s the man . &quot;
They &apos;re reconstructive .
I do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science , but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world .
But meanwhile , we should all keep in mind , we &apos;d do well to , that memory , like liberty , is a fragile thing .
One month after Mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
And then I realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby .
And here , the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain , nor that I preferentially form a tie with you because you and I share the same body size , but rather that we share a common exposure to something , like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time .
But we don &apos;t just experience them , we show them .
And so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
But if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way , you get diamond , which is clear and hard .
It is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
So , what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us .
I want to let you know it &apos;s not going to be easy , and it wasn &apos;t easy for me , because I faced a lot of obstacles .
What my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures .
We &apos;re still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .
In fact , if you see the map , the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma .
You &apos;ll get to see the incredible &#91; Chambal &#93; landscape as well .
Romulus Whitaker : I take the sort of humble approach , I guess you could say . I don &apos;t say that snakes are huggable exactly .
Journalism is about results .
Second official : I don &apos;t even know the place called &#91; unclear &#93; .
I say , &quot; This is the evidence . &quot;
So I was thinking about my own life , and how I &apos;d like to memorialize my life , you know , for the ages , and also — — the lives of my friends , but the problem with this is that my friends aren &apos;t quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them .
Josette Sheeran : Ending hunger now
We know how to fix hunger .
Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars , like we can , and pick the right one to match ?
I &apos;d like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope .
And we &apos;re seeing people transform their lives .
Sadly , in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat , four Americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
In 10 years , it &apos;s set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
He has to bury the people , OK ?
This stuff goes through you and your family &apos;s body every week .
We &apos;re not teaching our kids .
So , let me just show you .
There needs to be a new standard of fresh , proper food for your children . Yeah ?
It &apos;s incredibly important .
So , this whole dominance issue -- number one , what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system .
Then we phase out the food as a lure , and now the dog knows that &quot; sit &quot; means sit , and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence .
You leave this , the sanctity of your house , and you could be hit on the street .
Not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
And when it happens , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s nasty .
No one can say for sure , but I remember my first accident .
How can you predict the future ? That &apos;s really hard .
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone ?
BP : No need to be . There &apos;s nothing wrong with old age .
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad &apos;s face to bring the aging to this character .
And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under , really , all conditions .
And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour .
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses .
So really , a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben &apos;s head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that &apos;s on the other actors in the real world .
And the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer .
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie , and as the narrator .
The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience .
In the short-term , have you made me want to know what will happen next ?
Woody : What ? Am I hearing correctly ?
And that &apos;s what I think the magic ingredient is , the secret sauce , is can you invoke wonder .
But he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
I &apos;m telling you this story because Archie Cochrane , all his life , fought against a terrible affliction , and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies .
Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart .
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle .
I sometimes wonder .
And after the trial had been running for a little while , he gathered together all his colleagues around his table , and he said , &quot; Well , gentlemen , we have some preliminary results .
He made a lot of mistakes .
Yeah .
And he came out to the hallway and he said , &quot; Let me see the paper . &quot;
So after this experience , my art teacher , Mr. Shilale , he brought in these picture books , and I thought , &quot; Picture books for kids ! &quot;
You know ? You only get one birthday per year .
So I kind of said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s this extra ingredient , you know , that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog . &quot;
Like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
I &apos;m going to start way back in the third grade at Oakdale School in Barberton , Ohio .
So he &apos;d take people to this two-way mirror looking into the room where the snake was , and he &apos;d get them comfortable with that .
And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary .
We see people quit what they &apos;re doing and go in new directions .
But they wouldn &apos;t give me an answer .
It &apos;s a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues .
This year , they are now producing eight million nets a year , and they employ 5,000 people , 90 percent of whom are women , mostly unskilled .
Thank you .
Yet , if you analyze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , &quot; Hmm , let me see who I can pay a bribe to today . &quot;
For we are insane people , trying to do an impossible task .
Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks , funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair , where commemorating someone who &apos;s died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition .
But they don &apos;t put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age .
What they &apos;re not really doing is hiring .
But in the not-too-long-term , I think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room , we &apos;re going to transition into an economy that is very productive but that just doesn &apos;t need a lot of human workers , and managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces .
And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved .
And so for me , a mesh company , the &quot; classic &quot; mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
Any guesses ?
So in this way , I think that cities are platforms , and certainly Detroit is a platform .
They had some number of big successes .
And this is , of course , as you can see , the awake is the orange .
That &apos;s where this is all starting .
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd .
And sleep disorders .

In normal life for mother and calf dolphin , they &apos;ll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish , and when they separate they have to get back together again .
To me , the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean , deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound .
You can hear the full frequency range . It &apos;s quite loud .
Now imagine -- let &apos;s put the ship noise in the picture .
The shipping lanes have been moved .
There was no violence .
And that , actually , allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests , but it allowed us to do something else : to show what it was like to be in the protests , to present to people at home a subjective perspective .
It &apos;s a story of nations , of ideologies , of territories , and of conflicts among them .
Alright , one billion stars .
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process .
Why ?
Just over three years ago , I was for the first time in Caracas , Venezuela , and while flying over the city , I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city , a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums , draped literally all over the mountains .
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place , like that hotel in Sweden .
In these villages , you see an entirely altered landscape , and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square , rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground .
But if I &apos;m going to continue doing these adventures , there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
As they created their interactive Mother &apos;s Day cards , you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies .
So I think there &apos;s so many different ways that people can express themselves using this , to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world .
And that creates some new blocks for you , and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score , so each time I click on &quot; change score , &quot; it increments the score .
If you &apos;re interested in giving it a try , I &apos;d encourage you to go to the Scratch website .
Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal .
Are you ready to make the match ?
The world &apos;s many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase .
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended .
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat , now they &apos;ve got no choice but to cooperate because they &apos;re all in the same boat .
And it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hearth or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods .
What &apos;s missing ?
And it isn &apos;t until twice as long that they &apos;re all dead .
Part of it &apos;s on the outside , and it &apos;s catching the hormone as it comes by in green .
As you age , you &apos;re much more likely to get cancer , Alzheimer &apos;s disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent .
Matt Ridley : Thank you , Cynthia .
They &apos;re not getting old in the dog &apos;s lifespan .
Then , this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange .
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass .
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ...
But once in a while you get access to the control room , and then you can kind of mess with the dials .
Then a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled &quot; Being and Nothingness . &quot;
Second , security . Third , relationships .
The space age began 50 years ago in October , and that &apos;s exactly what Sputnik looked like .
It &apos;s designed like an Escher print .
But I brought along here a lump of coal -- right here , one lump of coal .
They &apos;ve done a lot of good for girls in these situations , and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years .
I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody . &quot;
And what happens is , she says , &quot; Please , sit down , be quiet , do what you &apos;re told , follow the rules , manage your time , focus , be a girl . &quot;
They &apos;re talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges , or whatever it is that they get .
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions .
I can help .
These machines that came out -- they started coming in the 1970s -- they would scan human bodies , and they would generate about 100 images of the human body .
So she &apos;s really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units .
So this will be the typical workflow situation .
So it &apos;s a very nice little device .
That means that it &apos;s possible to map out the activity of the brain .
And we &apos;ve been experimenting with this .
And it was gut wrenching .
It &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ...
And I also reported that we &apos;d made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole , consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane .
Why did America get serious ?
So , the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent .
So , I looked . Democracy does have significant effects -- and unfortunately , they &apos;re adverse .
That &apos;s our modest role . We cannot change these societies , but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing , because the odds are so stacked against them .
Black people are just as happy as white people are .
Quite consciously , design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques , just basically to fight straightforward adaptation .
The first step we did was to collect . We did 130 different sources of information -- from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news .
This is data , statistics . What does it tell us about these conflicts ?
The groups became stronger .
And it &apos;s live . It &apos;s not an image . So you click on it , you zoom in , right down to street view if you want to .
This is a dry lake bed .
Human time , industrial time , tested against the time of the tides , in which these memories of a particular body , that could be any body , multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction , many times , placed over three square miles , a mile out to sea , disappearing , in different conditions of day and night .
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally , but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal .
However , the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now .
So , I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational , and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money , or , you have to pay for it to be good , but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands .
This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds , or the paradox of collective intelligence , that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking .
So , in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story .
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .
K Girls and boys in Hyderabad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it .
I didn &apos;t want to stand out in the crowd anymore .
How does her father feel ?
In 2008 , one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow .
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda , Ghana , Nigeria ?
The BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected , and to help them drive the global digital revolution .
So you &apos;ve got traditional things like pepper spray , O.C. spray up at the top there , or Tasers over here .
I could only find these ones .
And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas .
And they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district , &quot; Police review policy after children shocked : 2nd child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks . &quot;
Oh look , there &apos;s another galaxy .
We have tried everything , viewed everything , bought everything .
But it &apos;s fundamentally different than what &apos;s happening in classrooms right now .
It &apos;ll change what happens at the dinner table .
But when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit &#91; of &#93; extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead .
And they said , &quot; Oh , this is kind of radical . We have to think about it . &quot;
When the dotcom bubble burst , hotelier Chip Conley went in search of a business model based on happiness . In an old friendship with an employee and in the wisdom of a Buddhist king , he learned that success comes from what you count .
I took one psychology class in college , and I learned about this guy , Abraham Maslow , as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs .
The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
Bhutan &apos;s bordered on its north and south by 38 percent of the world &apos;s population .
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success .
Well , what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years , is that goods have become commoditized .
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods , there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods ; there &apos;s a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods .
Well , if you think about that , you do , in fact , get a two-by-two .
Disney , 10 or 15 years ago , right , the Disney -- the company that is probably best-known for family values out there , Disney bought the ABC network .
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking .
Now , this is not just levitation . It &apos;s not just repulsion .
Amazing . Thank you .
Later on , in France , I loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; done &quot; World War II , that he had &quot; done &quot; the Algerian war .
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance .
They are both in their sixties now .
He said no .
And if , in the next couple of months , you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this , you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night , without any interruption , for the next four years .
And we didn &apos;t have the evidence for that .
And that &apos;s what many people now are trying to do .
And let &apos;s compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms .
You know , the computer and television both recently turned 60 , and today I &apos;d like to talk about their relationship .
By the year 2000 , the process was perfected . They merged with AOL , and in just four years , managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization , showing that they &apos;d actually mastered the art of applying Moore &apos;s law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet .
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system , deploy it all across the frozen north , and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place .
In fact , despair is in the air .
MM : The global village is a world in which you don &apos;t necessarily have harmony .
There was no metaphor . Was it a database ?
Eventually , the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company .
PH : Oh , but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch .
And whereas television may have gotten beat up , what &apos;s getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it .
I &apos;ve guessed you &apos;ve already noticed this by now .
And I want to score a point here , because my husband is in the room over there .
And in times of revolution or change like today , it is very important for independent media to have a voice .
N On Twitter also .
A breath that &apos;s fossilized now as iron .
But when that ancient continent broke up , life got lusher .
We call it &quot; atmosphere . &quot; This is the icon of our journey .
There &apos;s three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs : mechanical , how my limbs are attached to my biological body ; dynamic , how they move like flesh and bone ; and electrical , how they communicate with my nervous system .
How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone ?
So , when this is fully developed and for human use , persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone , but actually feel like flesh and bone .
We brought in dancers with biological limbs , and we studied how do they move , what forces do they apply on the dance floor , and we took those data and we put forth fundamental principles of dance , reflexive dance capability , and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb .
In fact , just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts , these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust .
The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs , we found a general pattern -- this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom -- that in fact , across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative .
Stephen Petranek : 10 ways the world could end
But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills .
California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years .
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth , and it &apos;s constantly bombarded by high-energy particles , like protons .
So far , our atmosphere has done , and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this .
We have a real , major outbreak of disease in the United States , we are not prepared to cope with it .
Of more concern , I think , is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter .
We know about this stuff .
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
Then we can start to use cells .
So , the bladder is one such organ .
This is actually an example -- several strategies to engineer solid organs .
Why ? Because they will not reject .
She had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
When the headlines rolled , what happened was , the marketers came calling .
The point here is , when you see activation in the insula , you can &apos;t just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list , and it &apos;s a really long list .
But that &apos;s not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway .
And that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space .
We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights .
So , as an organization , we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules , and we &apos;re actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories .
She got mad ; I took a licking .
I &apos;ve actually got a website that &apos;s got a bunch of photos that I &apos;ve done of some of the other folks I didn &apos;t get a chance to show you .
Well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -- it &apos;s hot .
Well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , I know .
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
Well , I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ; so did Michael .
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit .
We think of hippies of being just hedonists , but there &apos;s a very strong component -- I was in that movement -- a very strong component of being responsible for yourself .
But what we saw -- this is an MRI image .
This was bad .
The punch line is that a year and a half later , I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married .
This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks .
The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang , &quot; the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth . &quot;
This argument of course , shoots itself in the foot .
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists .
And I know that there are , if I could put a little plug here , there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question , and I put the suggestion up -- for what it &apos;s worth .
Which is , of course , our old friend , the &quot; don &apos;t rock the boat &quot; argument .
My god is a little god , and I want him to stay that way . &apos; A religion , old or new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths . &quot;
It &apos;s about 300 feet wide , the size of a football field , and it sits on just four very delicate columns .
So , what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there .
The original intention of this space , which was unfortunately never realized , was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out .
It &apos;s like a coffin , it basically sends all the sound , like a gutter-ball effect , down the aisles .
Now , this type of surgery is hard , and it starts by putting people to sleep , putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen , blowing them up like a balloon , sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen -- it &apos;s dangerous stuff -- and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen .
So I was inspired by a friend .
Because we need a lexicon . What is a lexicon ?
We have a need to learn as well as to teach .
So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand .
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies .
What does this mean ?
Donnell Leahy : Thank you . I &apos;m kind of new to the TED experience and I &apos;m glad to be here , but I &apos;m just trying to put it all together , trying to figure all you people out , and I &apos;ve been here for a short while , and I &apos;m starting to understand a little bit better .
We just started yesterday .
DL : Oh yeah , okay , in my family we had seven girls , four boys , we had two fiddles and one piano , and of course we were all fighting to play on the instruments , so dad and mom set a rule that you couldn &apos;t kick anyone off the instrument . You had to wait until they were finished , so of course , what we would do is we &apos;d get on the piano and you wouldn &apos;t even get off to eat , because you wouldn &apos;t want to give it up to your brother or sister , and they &apos;d wait and wait and wait , and it &apos;d be midnight and you &apos;d be still sitting there on the piano , but it was their way to get us to practice .
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent .
If you &apos;re under 50 we want you to work four more years .
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures .
But , of course , for most of us , we know how to grow teeth , and therefore we can take adult stem teeth , put them on a biodegradable mold , re-grow a tooth , and simply implant it .
In the last Olympics , this gentleman , who had several world records in the Special Olympics , tried to run in the normal Olympics .
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
And I immediately came upon a problem .
And if any of you ever have a chance , backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world &apos;s best collections of preserved mantis shrimp . And what -- this is serious business for me .
And again , we were in for a surprise .
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks : what I think was going on is : that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell , and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble .
The bubbles are the countries .
And here , children don &apos;t live longer .
And I &apos;m going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there , and the brownish Volvo .
We can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here ?
It comes beyond here , when you really can get good working conditions in the family .
We have to know a little more about the world .
Health I give two points . I mean it &apos;s nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here , you &apos;re healthy .
And he said , &quot; Well , get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here , and I &apos;ll teach it to you . &quot;
We also created a boardroom , and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto , Japan , and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building .
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food .
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education .
And the woman came out of the audience , she said , &quot; That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation .
If you &apos;d have dropped a bomb on that room , you &apos;d have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there .
And I built the first building , and guess what happened ?
I said , &quot; Well , I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card . &quot;
I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we &apos;re spending on prisons .
We &apos;re culture-bound listeners .
Here &apos;s what it looked like in the laboratory .
Thank you .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
I mean , did he ?
But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
So like , you can &apos;t feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease , and inbreeding and incest and , let &apos;s see , what &apos;s the other one ?
Could we jump-start that memory back to life , maybe even play with the contents of that memory ?
Could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
Now Xu and I , on the other hand , were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen .
Now the next day , we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they &apos;ve never experienced before .
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference , she &apos;d gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts .
Here you &apos;re going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today , reconstructed of Marc Hodosh , the curator of TEDMED .
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way .
And we &apos;re entering an era of really , truly scarless surgery called NOTES , where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically .
We can now leverage microfluidics , like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford .
What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ?
And as a cancer doctor , I &apos;m looking forward to being out of a job .
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers , and I myself , I &apos;m not going to give you many answers today , just ask a lot of questions .
And so we first measured the number of notes .
That was challenging .
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
Which will happen around 2020 .
This is not Moore &apos;s Law .
But Larry Page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting , saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity .
And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself -- or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financiers .
He told us that , in fact , two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent , the taxpayers &apos; money , was wasted or stolen .
And he &apos;s telling us that for the $ 1.6 billion cost of the project , one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in Europe .
The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
They have international branches , and it &apos;s important for us to tune into this one .
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives .
The classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they &apos;ve been conducted and completed , and then you go and see if they &apos;ve been published anywhere in the academic literature . So this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA .
But they didn &apos;t hold the line . In 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the ICMJE weren &apos;t properly registered , and a quarter of them weren &apos;t registered at all .
So , we created the LXD , sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers , a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world .
You go from drug formulation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market .
Wouldn &apos;t you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you &apos;re going to take are going to work on your cancer ?
So , what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization .
Unfortunately , I don &apos;t fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but I assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it &apos;s a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people &apos;s realm of moral awareness . I think the non-zero-sum dynamic , which is not only economic by any means -- it &apos;s not always commerce -- but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth , which is the fundamental equality of everyone . It has done that .
Doing the best I can , OK .
What I want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
But does this then mean , as many people tend to think , that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people -- on different continents , for example ?
Did we mix or not ?
Presumably , modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa .
Let &apos;s talk about a battle space .
We don &apos;t think you can pull it off , we &apos;re not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder . &quot;
Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan .
We had six months to feel the lob , to get the job done , and we dicked around for six months .
China , all grown up , going to be a looker !
Security has meant everything else .
It &apos;s why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries .
That &apos;s where the National Guard &apos;s going to be .
Bad news is they may not have anybody on them . &quot;
Take a gift in the left hand .
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes , not just as our home .
Because if it &apos;s big and obvious , we would &apos;ve already found it -- it would &apos;ve already bitten us on the foot , and it hasn &apos;t .
There &apos;s so much life in this cave , and I can &apos;t even begin to scratch the surface of it with you .
In order to access these sub-surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
It &apos;s easy to imagine saving money next week , but how about right now ? Generally , we want to spend it . Economist Shlomo Benartzi says this is one of the biggest obstacles to saving enough for retirement , and asks : How do we turn this behavioral challenge into a behavioral solution ?
So where does it take us ?
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week .
What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called Save More , not today , Tomorrow .
This is really the tip of the iceberg .
We &apos;ve -- No , first of all , New York Magazine always gets it .
So it &apos;s happened before , and it will happen in the future , but right now I can tell you that I am so , so proud to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection .
Of course , there are games that are even more educational .
But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design . Aesthetics are really important .
I &apos;ve had to do away with a few concepts of design past .
We can see world-changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world &apos;s medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action .
Earth Witness would show us two worlds : the world we &apos;re leaving behind , and the world we &apos;re building for generations to come .
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models , powerful tools , and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet &apos;s future .
He &apos;s got pneumonia , and he looks like he needs intensive care .
The dying process of those with terminal illness that we &apos;ve just seen occurs to younger people .
Why can &apos;t we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this ?
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain .
So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive , I create a ball , a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from , and roll , at home or at work , towards aggressive noise , and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .
And the irony for me was of course , I didn &apos;t do that for the sake of science progress .
We could talk about a kind of soul , of a ghost accompanying them .
So your sofa , your plastic chair , your kid &apos;s toys give their own invisible reality . And this one is very toxic .
Your seat , your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather .
Look at the client base for this .
In terms of weapons , the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy .
And in China , right now , they &apos;re putting up five gigawatts of nuclear .
Now if we go to the area , lots is worse than nuclear or wind .
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran , maybe Venezuela , that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff .
Alex : Hi , I &apos;m Alex . I just wanted to say , I &apos;m , first of all , renewable energy &apos;s biggest fan .
And especially the small reactors need to go forward .
The pictures that I was finding were years out of date , and because of that , it had relatively little relevance to the work that I was doing today .
From our own computer simulations , we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy , for the first time , being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis , while conveniently still not being able to see individuals .
OK , now , cross your hands over , so your right hand goes over , interlace your fingers like this , then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb -- that &apos;s very important .
And I &apos;m going to try that right now .
That &apos;s the question .
Come in a little bit closer .
And can you take a seat right over here for me , if you don &apos;t mind .
OK , it worked that time , excellent .
I want you to examine the shard of glass .
KB : I was going to use you for this , but I decided I might want to come back another year .
KB : No ?
This is your decision , not mine .
It &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
We &apos;ve had the Internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
That was enough of citizen media .
An incredible conversation sprung up there .
If you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and I think that &apos;s going to change .
It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
College graduates are not in short supply .
So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .
Post-9 / 11 , &#91; the &#93; United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with , their own internal issues .
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges .
We will extend the same system into other areas , like dialysis treatment .
Looked for something different for the second one .
His restaurant is open seven months every year .
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica , the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto , in Portugal .
It says , &quot; Self-confidence produces fine results . &quot;
And I &apos;m happy I &apos;m alive .
I wanted to become a teacher .
I was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do .
They all came together .
But she was older . She was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before .
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art , Subodh Gupta .
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal , perhaps a little too much .
Now what we &apos;re seeing lots of examples of , obviously , is the opening up of government data , not enough examples of this yet , but we &apos;re starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data .
They &apos;re just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago .
And with that call , my life would change forever .
So it had been a huge gamble , but it had paid off .
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference .
And I &apos;m going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts .
RS : That &apos;s exactly right .
RS : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua &apos;s sandwich ?
Whereas on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief , and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident .
RS : Yeah , we worry about this .
As an altar boy , I breathed in a lot of incense , and I learned to say phrases in Latin , but I also had time to think about whether my mother &apos;s top-down morality applied to everybody .
So in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty .
Two things .
I just found the molecule behind it .
So if you trust them , their brains don &apos;t release oxytocin .
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love .
The other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that &apos;s related to various brain functions but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line : The brain abhors a vacuum .
We had a car that came by , same identical car as described by the teenagers , right ?
Think about how we select our judges in this country .
I presently , or currently , work with smart materials , and a smart thermo-bimetal .
The problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . They &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
How important is this ?
And , you know , after keeping these books for a number of years , I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts , but also the artifacts of other people .
Finally , location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map , giving you a sense of their geographic distribution .
Stories take place in a certain area . They have contexts .
These whales are about 40 feet long , and weighing over 40 tons . And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word &quot; love &quot; engraved on it , and she &apos;d found it in the road somewhere .
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet .
Catarina Mota : Play with smart materials
Secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers .
All right . One , two , three .
Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
Over a few days , the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies , billions of dollars in maintaining , trying to maintain , its prisons , collapsed , disappeared , because of the voices of the public .
In front of Facebook , they brought the camels in Tahrir Square .
The future has arrived , and the future is now .
Economics PhD Sebastião Salgado only took up photography in his 30s , but the discipline became an obsession . His years-long projects beautifully capture the human side of a global story that all too often involves death , destruction or decay . Here , he tells a deeply personal story of the craft that nearly killed him , and shows breathtaking images from his latest work , Genesis , which documents the world &apos;s forgotten people and places .
I started to have infection everywhere .
And I went . I started in the beginning of 2004 , and I finished at the end of 2011 .
I want to show you now , to finish , just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction .
Think about that .
He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India , and after discovering this information , the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai .
Recently , the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States , who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives into government buildings in the United States .
Well , with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things .
So maybe there &apos;s a more radical way that we can look at this .
And why have we , as Americans particularly , become a nation that strives for security above all else ?
In six years , I &apos;ve had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day , a global movement against &#91; violence against &#93; women , to travel probably to 60 countries , and spend a great deal of time in different portions .
So she really struggled with this , what to do , because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion . So what she did is she got all her friends together -- I believe it was 100 , 150 students all wore &quot; I love my vagina &quot; T-shirts , and the boys wore &quot; I love her vagina &quot; T-shirts to school .
In the shared future , it will be just that , shared .
Unless you &apos;re like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy .
Now , if I hadn &apos;t paid attention to embodied energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house .
You would have three groups of four , and you would count it , a-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four . Together .
A-rhythm-etic .
That problem is solved .
So for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
There &apos;s sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information , and that might tell you it &apos;s going to land in that red spot .
Everything left over is external to me .
So if they retaliate with the same force , the first person will think it &apos;s been escalated .
You will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young -- a huge amount of information .
DW : No , no , actually I think they &apos;re all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end .
An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off , until an intelligent plug is detected . Simple .
So when this machine breaks , the machines they have to work with break , they &apos;ve got to try and figure it out , but most of the time , that &apos;s the end of the road .
Voila !
Is this the design that &apos;s going to work in place ?
For example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park .
It &apos;s called &quot; All the Answers . &quot;
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
&quot; Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht -- &quot; It &apos;s not finished yet .
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline .
You see , that &apos;s the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea : it &apos;s new . So there is no existing tradition in it .
It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
It &apos;s all right there .
It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
And the results can be pretty funny .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
We have to fix our media .
So you start to hear these abusive voices , but you don &apos;t hear one abusive voice , you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices , like if the Devil had Tourette &apos;s , that &apos;s what it would sound like .
So you &apos;ve got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane , so , you see what the problem is ? What once made you safe now drives you insane .
You can move objects from one area to another .
They &apos;re not the same . The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one .
Isn &apos;t it weird ? You know , if collaboration is so cool , is cross-functional working is so amazing , why did we build these huge hierarchies ? What &apos;s going on ?
What &apos;s happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it . They &apos;ve changed the rules from laminar to turbulent .
Believe it or not , this is a quote from an Israeli prime minister , but it &apos;s not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir from the era of the Shah .
In some ways , this sounds paradoxical , but according to Martin Indyk of the Clinton administration , the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong , because the more peace there would be between Israel and Palestine , the U.S. believed , the more Iran would get isolated .
So a plague outbreak in Surat , India becomes not an obscure event , but a globalized event -- a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation .
And we don &apos;t have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease .
You &apos;re the mayor of your local town .
The rest turns into a stable compound , which survives filtration into the water systems , thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing them a chance to breed resistant strains .
The Institute of Medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks .
Can you talk about that ?
And I would just add we saw the same thing with SARS .
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
And about a second after I took the picture , they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other .
So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore .
This was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
It &apos;s on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is , do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else ?
And I &apos;m going to show you the first experiment that we did .
So we &apos;re getting very close to the human sense of fairness .
I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie , because I am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect .
So knowledge is a big subject , but I would say ignorance is a bigger one .
This graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it .
So what is it that &apos;s the most difficult thing for a brain to do ?
They &apos;re interested .
We learn , maybe not the famous TED audience , but so many other people learn , that the unknown , the doubts , the question marks are dangerous .
I deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing .
That &apos;s when you throw out all the ballast , all the certainties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
For that , unfortunately , four meters wingspan is not enough .
This is a painting from Magritte , in the museum in Holland that I love so much .
But if I had one thing to say about this , before we get to first , it would be that from the time we started building this , the big idea wasn &apos;t the technology .
And again , I say that not to attack any industry , I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane , and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view .
So we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what &apos;s important , and how to apply the technology .
But if you could put a pin in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one half-hour , it &apos;s the city .
For this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story .
And the Higgs field , in the ultra-dense Higgs state , is not just a few times more intense than today , but billions of times , and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state , all atomic matter would collapse .
My story does not have an end , because we still don &apos;t know the end of the story .
And this is how we began .
The average teenager sends 3,300 texts every &#91; month &#93; .
Here &apos;s what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it .
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position .
The main unit will then go inside the brain .
And that &apos;s my friend . I mean , I charge it every night .
And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers , and there &apos;s a lot of innovation happening because it &apos;s all open-source .
There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community , and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language , beautifully typeset .
Or again , another project where , by analyzing the Twitter feed of a family , you can basically point where they are , like in the &quot; Harry Potter &quot; movie .
Thank you .
In science , we don &apos;t care how many letters you have after your name .
But that &apos;s because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil , they &apos;re freaks , they &apos;re not normal , they &apos;re like you ; they come to events like this .
So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated , which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo .
And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared , have gone missing in action .
I &apos;m very sorry if you have the flu , I know it &apos;s horrible , but we &apos;re not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day .
So , basically the &quot; Internet &quot; has two Internets .
So when these 300 million people , microbloggers , even they block the tweet in our censored platform .
For example , they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard .
The cat is the censorship , but Chinese is not only one cat , but also has local cats . Central cat and local cats .
So my conclusion is very simple .
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest .
And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
They &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
So , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa , who are part of this team now -- from Ghana , from Malawi , from Kenya .
And it &apos;s a community around it that has decided to build this .
Mars comes to mind .
One-way trips are easy .
But business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
We need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
But not just that , they actually banned money .
She &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
According to his biographer , &quot; He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot;
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine ?
But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
Okay . Who here , it does nothing for them ?
Half of them are told that they &apos;re being given the shocks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn &apos;t know they &apos;re giving them shocks .
They opened their scores , the conductor gave the downbeat , and boom , they launched into the Kyrie from the &quot; Requiem &quot; by Mozart .
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts .
So I told the singers , &quot; That &apos;s our goal .
Virtual Choir : The evening hangs beneath the moon A silver thread on darkened dune With closing eyes and resting head I know that sleep is coming soon Upon my pillow , safe in bed , a thousand pictures fill my head I cannot sleep my mind &apos;s aflight and yet my limbs seem made of lead If there are noises in the night Eric Whitacre : Thank you very , very much . Thank you .
I &apos;m talking about the elite .
But I didn &apos;t really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore .
And it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school .
That for many of them , it has been a life-altering experience .
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
But we can &apos;t possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct .
This is why it &apos;s happening .
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime .
We put them in bottles , refrigerate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
Now it &apos;s important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it &apos;s powered by water .
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning , and that &apos;s been something that &apos;s been nurturing me for some time , and it &apos;s an important statement to understand .
1851 : The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made , clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation .
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land .
As payment for the Black Hills , the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation .
It &apos;s not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti , or ending AIDS , or fighting a famine .
In Judaism , though , we tend to always say , there has to be a middle way .
This &quot; 18 minutes &quot; business , I find quite fascinating .
Next week , with raisins . &quot;
Together , we raised four wonderful children .
I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own .
And this seemed very interesting to me .
Well , when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new , as this man is , he doesn &apos;t have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels , or his problems at home .
And we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about .
I can photograph it from any angle , and it will still look 2D .
We got a pool . We filled it with milk .
It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country .
Until the day my father died , he was frustrated about missing these shots .
And trade is another important incentive against violence .
Niall Ferguson : The 6 killer apps of prosperity
So it really doesn &apos;t look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence .
Let &apos;s call them the killer apps .
Hardly anyone in South America did .
Any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 -- only faster .
Niall Ferguson : Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East ; I &apos;m talking about the rise of the Rest , and that includes South America .
I didn &apos;t know this word until I arrived .
And don &apos;t despise the white bread because it really , I think , symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all .
And this is where I have to query all of you .
And I &apos;m making a real plea here .
There are all kinds of ways we can do it .
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
Over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist .
and — — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh , and I &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh , and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me , and I think , &quot; He looks Bangladeshi , &quot; — — and I just have those two facts , and I just think , &quot; This could work somehow . &quot;
In my mind , there is something to learn from the history of Europe .
So naturally , I -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty .
Poor people apparently don &apos;t have the power to buy .
Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank , get a phone and have the phone for everybody .
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors .
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
Now , how do you help these patients ?
So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
Thank you .
It &apos;s taken out of Africa .
There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said that &quot; Here in Lesotho , we &apos;ve got two problems : rats and the government . &quot;
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries .
We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor .
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference , and everyone that I met over there who &apos;s an entrepreneur struggled with school .
My first little business venture : I was seven years old , I was in Winnipeg , and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords .
But it was obvious to me , right ? Buy low , sell high .
So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown .
So I just packaged them . I &apos;m like 12 , right ?
But then we negotiate on what they &apos;re going to get paid .
All these traits you can find in young kids , and you can help nurture them .
He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects .
It wasn &apos;t easy . McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy , but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence , and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows , which were works of performance art in their own right , and we proceeded to do something at the museum , I think , we &apos;ve never done before .
Richard Dawkins : Why the universe seems so strange
He stared at his wall in Arlington , Virginia , and decided to do it .
We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn &apos;t walk through rocks .
Could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability , which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at .
And so , the day of the scheduled procession , thousands of people showed up .
Now , as a business professor , and as any business professor would tell you , an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure , good incentives , a solid identity and good brand management .
They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border , and you can see that these are not &quot; The Shawshank Redemption &quot; types .
And I took it to MIT press and they said , &quot; Cute , but not for us . Go and find somebody else . &quot;
What do you see the color that top arrow is pointing to ?
But it turns out that from organ donation they are very different .
It &apos;s the opposite . It &apos;s because we care .
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
Now the most popular option became the least popular .
But there is a silver lining .
Now , I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes , and see with your hands because you &apos;re not looking at your hands , you &apos;re looking at where the balls are or you &apos;re looking at the audience .
Bring it back up .
But I want you to do is also , with your eyes , is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow .
Well , obviously , there &apos;s something in here , and you can all have a guess as to what it is .
This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .
Let &apos;s not forget it &apos;s a functional entity .
Shouldn &apos;t you be doing something about this ? Why haven &apos;t you had it removed ? &quot;
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations , as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly .
I &apos;ll move it off , and we &apos;ll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .
This is a horrific image , so I &apos;m putting my hand up now .
We &apos;re still not curing enough patients -- it &apos;s the most disfiguring cancer .
And I &apos;m delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue , and the U.S. in red .
So , I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator , and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in .
We were standing out in the desert all alone and , thinking about my house , he said , &quot; Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent , somewhere in 2000 years somebody &apos;s going to like it ? &quot;
He &apos;s been a cheerleader for quite a long time .
FG : No , it &apos;s near the current campus .
I was clean . There wasn &apos;t a bloody leak in the place , it was just fantastic .
Each one was more beautiful than the other .
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment , and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .
And that has to do with me because in 1994 , I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
So let &apos;s start on that .
Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days .
Uganda : the New Forest Company , replanting and redeveloping their forests . Why is that important ?
Some other figures . South Africa : triple B-plus . Botswana : A-plus .
So , that &apos;s 20 micrometers across , that pollen grain there .
Now , all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from , and that &apos;s actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from .
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion .
This is so blatant , so extreme .
But with the type of cuts we &apos;re talking about , it will be far , far harder to get these incentives for excellence , or to move over to use technology in the new way .
And that &apos;s the kind of thing -- the investment in the young -- that makes us great , allows us to contribute .
So there &apos;s only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle .
we got a text from Dan saying that , now , the first blue colonies existed .
But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we &apos;re already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
&quot; Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days . &quot; Bang .
It &apos;s gone in and out of fashion .
Shift work . Shift work is extraordinary , perhaps 20 percent of the working population , and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night .
And one of the things of stress , of course , is loss of memory , which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of .
They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late , so give them a break .
The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate , make worse the mental illness state .
How could it not have sunk in when they &apos;d been telling me ?
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom , and I read my horoscope every single day , and it was so totally me .
All but one guy , this guy named Mormon , who managed to survive by hiding in the woods .
Because I wasn &apos;t exactly sure how I felt about that question .
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny , but we are truly , wonderfully significant .
I mean , what is a biosphere ?
When it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
It broke down ; it took oxygen out of the air ; it put CO2 into the air ; and it went into the concrete .
It is so dry .
This is the story of a rake in my backyard .
We &apos;ll start here .
The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here .
NASA has devoted money to this .
I think even NASA can do that , and they proved that they can .
We have the ability to change our future .
I look around , and I go , &quot; My God , look at all these gay people !
And I &apos;m disturbed by this because I &apos;ve been openly gay now for quite some time .
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda .
It is the network ; and in my case , the network has been important in media , because I get to connect to people .
We have to remix it . He &apos;s got a great voice .
A Childhood Walk , which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop , to a neighbor &apos;s house , and take it inside of Google Streetview .
&quot; From a 48 to a 52 , may your party &apos;s leadership be as classy as you , but I doubt it . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m really anxious , I just moved to a new town , I have this new job , and I &apos;ve just had this incredible amount of anxiety . &quot;
That means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .
And Conan Doyle , writing about Bell , described the following exchange between Bell and his students .
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .
And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care .
I then proceeded to tell the patient , once the patient was dressed , the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions , which is , &quot; This is not in your head .
It was an offering , an invitation .
This was the first one .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
There &apos;s one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor .
The &apos; 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century .
So if you think of a map of your country , I think you &apos;ll realize that for every country on Earth , you could draw little circles to say , &quot; These are places where good teachers won &apos;t go . &quot;
Sugata Mitra : I took the experiment to South Africa .
They said , &quot; We look at it every day . &quot;
The children enthusiastically got after me and said , &quot; Now , what do you want us to do ? &quot;
This is what I &apos;m building now -- they &apos;re called SOLEs : Self Organized Learning Environments .
Imagine hearing great , departed pianists play again today , just as they would in person . John Q. Walker demonstrates how recordings can be analyzed for precise keystrokes and pedal motions , then played back on computer-controlled grand pianos .
What I &apos;d like you to hear live is the 1955 version , and we &apos;ll play the first couple pieces of it .
Audio has come very late to this game -- I &apos;m not talking about digitizing , and bits , and re-mastering .
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949 .
But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow , wagging her tail .
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball , and he or she &apos;s going to roll down a hill .
We don &apos;t know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain , because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .
That &apos;s a shame .
And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring , and to try and do something about it .
Unfortunately , that hasn &apos;t been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation , National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .
Now , the environments like you see here , dusty environments in Africa where I grew up , and I loved wildlife , and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing .
Now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it doesn &apos;t , the grassland and the soil begin to die .
The production of grass , shrubs , trees , wildlife , everything is now more productive , and we have virtually no fear of dry years .
That is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
And she , of course , naturally as a nine-year-old , looked at me and said quizzically , &quot; What &apos;s literacy ? &quot;
Thank you .
So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software .
A student said , &quot; This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who &apos;s explaining something you haven &apos;t grasped , but are about to . &quot;
Well , we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together , but there are more ideas to try .
Bright as a button . All the ducks in a row .
&apos;Tis but folly to be waging war On one who never lost before .
What of the titans of media ?
And from another nurse , I begged a pencil , pen .
It was absolutely unbelievable .
But then a few years later , her mother died , and that seemed stranger still , because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever .
You have chosen not to know .
Ignorance is bliss , they say , but you can &apos;t put up with things like this . &quot;
Every day , we allow our coworkers , who are otherwise very , very nice people , to steal from us .
And in fact , some of the biggest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company .
I &apos;d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .
For even in my own life , there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life .
And they turned at once and walked away .
Perhaps it was the crutches , but it seemed -- -- it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again .
And did I want to come with ?
Thank you for your kind attention .
Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
In fact , one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam , which technically possibly counts as cheating .
In the midst of hardship , it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul .
And probably , if I were to fill out Jim Citrin &apos;s scale , I &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
This is the same village in Cambodia , just a couple of months ago .
But if you take a different approach , and you think of very large-scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing -- so you &apos;re pouring chemicals in one end , iPods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
The camel smells were unbelievable .
We &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
So , &quot; Sonority is time and meaning &quot; -- a great quote .
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
I want what I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back Gone with the last train , honey don &apos;t you fret Every cloud has a silver lining Just a little rain , just a little rain , just a little rain I want what I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have My mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me My mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says , &quot; Good things come to those who wait &quot; And I can &apos;t stand in ... I can &apos;t stand in line forever Stand the cold air Glad-handed Sick and tired of the &quot; Later , maybe &quot; Take it , fake it , take it , take-it-or-leave-it life And I gotta just tame it I gotta just name it I gotta just seize , so please , oh please , oh please , oh please Oh please me right , &apos; cause My mind won &apos;t stop And my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me My mind won &apos;t stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... Good things must be here -- yes , right here Here , right here , right here I won &apos;t live this life forever One time round is all the offer is Sick and tired of the &quot; Later , maybe &quot; Take it , fake it , make it , leave it life And I gotta just name it , I gotta just claim it I gotta just seize Oh please , oh please , oh please me right I want what I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have -- you know that My mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me , no My mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go &apos; Cause I want what I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I -- have what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have what I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have , what I want What I can &apos;t have , need what I can &apos;t want Have but I don &apos;t have what I want
And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we &apos;ve all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they &apos;re about to bring by market .
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO &apos;s , but also shop-girls -- yeah .
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen , then it &apos;s the benign ones that tend to be the winners .
If it didn &apos;t produce a lot of this toxin , then you might find a smaller number .
So , this is very encouraging , it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow , if we had enough money , could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck .
And there &apos;s a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this .
And all I &apos;m saying is that we need to figure out how they &apos;ll evolve , so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck , so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go .
And secondly , they are the smallest reality .
Does any one of you in the audience have that person ?
The productive margin in our governments &apos; search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy , it lies with international donors .
There you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .
Thank you for that reaction .
My cholesterol went down , I lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant .
And just to give you one instance of this : food .
It &apos;s just dough that is wet .
Then we go into final shaping , &quot; panning &quot; -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan .
And we harvest those seeds , and those are the wheat kernels .
Bacteria is in there , eating the same sugars , turning them into acids .
We &apos;re going to take some of that , and put it into the bread .
So here &apos;s a video .
So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
Another is that there are bold , new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet .
All right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communicating in real time .
This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
When earthquakes take place , massive amounts of these new microbes we &apos;ve never seen before come out of the sea floor .
A Swedish mathematician , von Koch , decided that instead of subtracting lines , he would add them .
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back , and then you have the chief &apos;s ring here towards the back and then the chief &apos;s immediate family in that ring .
It is not the same pattern at two different scales .
He said , &quot; but wind and dust goes through pretty easily .
Leibniz , the German mathematician , talked about geomancy in his dissertation called &quot; De Combinatoria . &quot;
It was taken 18 years ago .
Now , the deeper you go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
We needed more time .
We also have a second oxygen cylinder , that &apos;s solely as a back-up in case there &apos;s a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe .
We also see sharks , much more regularly than I would have expected to .
Here &apos;s another new angelfish we discovered .
When we recovered his body , we figured out what had gone wrong .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa .
It can only be understood in the context of story , and everything , all of this is story .
And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country , and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams , and a Jewish Nazi hunter .
I &apos;m more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer , I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent .
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet .
It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
So I went to work programming it , and I released it just before the holidays in 2010 .
PM : So when we first started talking about , maybe the subject wouldn &apos;t be social media , which we assumed it would be , but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions , particularly in the sector of technology and social media .
And she said , I can do this .
PM : Can we send that to a lot of other people that we know ?
What part of that has surprised you , and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ?
PM : Thank you , Sheryl .
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe , that are giving you your genetic profiles , are giving some people a sense of , &quot; Gosh , well , what can I do about it ? &quot;
So let &apos;s have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let &apos;s make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happier .
So we went , in fact , to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness .
This was a huge criticism that we got to say , if you can &apos;t show it with dodgeball teams , this is all stupid .
Or there is no Internet , like Facebook , MySpace , YouTube , for them to talk .
Friends like Lual who died by my side , of starvation .
And why are my people poor .
So it &apos;s taken me 232 days .
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA .
The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist .
And there are three main stages .
Now , until 9-11 , the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States .
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars .
So , what do we architects need to do ? We need to stitch back creation and execution .
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .
Meaning : The artistic director doesn &apos;t necessarily need to go through our lobby .
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium .
Again , just a couple people are required .
We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
And it was an amazing learning experience because , for me , human rights have been something in which I had , you know , a part-time interest , but , mainly , it was something that happened to other people over there .
Peter Gabriel : So torture is not something that always happens on other soil .
It &apos;s pure white , but it &apos;s not a polar bear .
And as he ate , he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth , he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth .
And so I &apos;m just so happy that the dive is over .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
And this was the first thing she did .
And I thought , she &apos;s about to bite .
The question isn &apos;t whether or not I know you .
We have to change the norms .
It had no limits . It was invincible .
These stories saturated my cells and nerves , and to be honest , I stopped sleeping for three years .
And in the name of connectedness , she said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s the Gulf of Mexico . &quot;
I &apos;m five years old , and I am very proud .
He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books , two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots . And this was his treasure .
There is a historical archive .
We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things .
We can also look at , at a grander scale , what creates problems , what creates disease , and how we may be able to fix them .
In other words , we &apos;re not , sort of , unique little organisms running around ; we are part of a big ecosystem .
These are chemical factories ; the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature , and we now can use those .
And I hope , and one of my biggest dreams , is that , with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world , that we &apos;ll give them the respect and protection that they deserve .
So I started cold-calling , and eventually got through to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh , and she invited me down .
So can you please go ahead ?
But it leads to what is coming next .
Right , and do you have a web address that we might look for yet ?
So , very unexpectedly , they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales .
But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned , to happen sooner and with higher confidence , then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic .
But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour , the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones , weighing a total of 15 pounds , hidden in the front end .
For example , fee-bates , a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles .
Ours is on the demand side .
So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead , and had no clue quite what was going to happen , I was alive .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
If you design a city with the blind in mind , you design a city with a robust , accessible , well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around .
So you &apos;re six years old , you &apos;re reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world : dwarves and Prince Charmings .
So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan , Chairman of the Federal Reserve , claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor .
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin , who is the chair of the Classics department at USC .
Like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself .
You know , the toes of the gecko , curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen .
But being too prepared doesn &apos;t leave room for the accidents to happen .
Where you say , like , &apos; 87 was like a good year , right ?
I said , &quot; Oh , wow , this is an important study . &quot;
And their kids have an advantage .
So how much money did we just spend on all of that ?
You know , they convinced me . I &apos;m sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing , the PalmPilot .
They harass you , right ? They call you , they say , &quot; I want to see your grades . How &apos;d you do on that last test ?
Adam Spencer : Why I fell in love with monster prime numbers
And today , I want to show you one of those musical notes , a number so beautiful , so massive , I think it will blow your mind .
We know that - 1 is a prime number .
And then Curtis Cooper got it back .
But for me it &apos;s amazing because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time in which we live , when human minds and machines can conquer together .
Amory Lovins : A 40-year plan for energy
And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security , or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health , reinventing fire makes sense and makes money .
They are all-American , carbon-free and inexhaustible .
And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends .
That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
But with today &apos;s much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
Not just the horses , but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk , that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died , and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street .
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods , people who hadn &apos;t , you know , percentages of people who hadn &apos;t , but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .
The whole world is laid out for you , the best jobs are laid out for you , and you want to go and work in a village ?
A professional is someone who has a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
No water , rocky soil . &quot;
And what do we teach in these schools ?
Why ? Because they want to leave the village and go to a city , looking for a job .
He said , &quot; Do you know there &apos;s a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone ? &quot;
I &apos;ll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi .
The proof of this came in Chile , almost a month later , when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile .
So , according to dung beetles , dung is pretty good .
The thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a behavior called path integration .
I started my journey in California with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life .
That &apos;s like 25 grand a smile .
You can think what your own habit is , whether it &apos;s a new car , a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink .
So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career .
Charlie Bresler said to me that he &apos;s not an altruist .
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
After some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
And he &apos;s found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . That &apos;s remarkable , but up until now , there weren &apos;t ways to do it without cutting down trees .
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale .
And my father , who worked at night , would spend every afternoon with her , just to make sure she ate .
Linda is a middle-aged woman , who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart .
Sadly , Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease .
Women &apos;s health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay .
But not only houses , also small debris from one city , from San Diego , to Tijuana .
They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border , they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool , because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city .
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small , like this , and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it , kids who didn &apos;t want to be outside could do it , and everyone could have access .
So CNN called , and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer &apos;s market .
And what does it really do ?
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm .
Big kids love strawberries and bananas .
I saw photographs of her , and I thought I wanted to go .
It was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
And on Christmas Day , I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram -- back in those days , you got telegrams -- from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died , and left their child in a will to me .
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow ?
This is a social worker interviewing Hyun-Sook .
So , the second night , we didn &apos;t keep the kids &apos; room , because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage .
And the other is unbelievable guilt .
The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through .
Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; Once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta . &quot;
Some say up to five tons .
And about two and a half , 3,000 sharks were killed up till &apos; 85 , many by Norwegian vessels .
Half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
If you look at nucleotide diversity , which is more genetics that are passed on through parents , you can see that basking sharks , if you look at the first study , was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species .
Well one obvious source is dead sharks , Dead sharks washed up .
And so he was all very excited .
I &apos;ll take that as my scientific legacy .
Now if those books are not lost to history , then they are somewhere in a library , and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google , which has scanned 15 million books to date .
And you also knew , more or less , that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair , &quot; Tom , what should I say ? &quot;
But if you want to reach the very top , you should delay gratification and , of course , become a politician .
It &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
Some of the world &apos;s most baffling social problems , says Peter Eigen , can be traced to systematic , pervasive government corruption , hand-in-glove with global companies . In his talk , Eigen describes the thrilling counter-attack led by his organization , Transparency International .
No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany , but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia , everywhere , systematically bribed .
Why ? Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain .
This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design .
And then , I made a Lego animator .
Throughout this whole thing , making toys , I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science .
And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby -- I have kind of the art and science .
So here &apos;s a little pink one , a little pouf on his head .
And Hasbro made about , you know , a billion and a half dollars .
There &apos;s the skull , pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus .
There &apos;s something big and loud over here .
Willie Smits : How to restore a rainforest
When I stood there in the grass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass .
So beautiful . What a theory .
But , it &apos;s more complicated . It &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture .
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel , and they can build a house , they have some fuel wood to cook with .
I have a big interest in education , and I think we all do .
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And slightly to one side .
We know three things about intelligence .
Now , I think ... What I think it comes to is this : Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson .
So with all of this diversity in structure , one might think , then , that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction .
We &apos;ve seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there &apos;s something very , very special about man .
SS : This is Kanzi and I , in the forest .
By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human , and documenting their development across two decades , scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution .
Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go .
Now you can chase them again . Time to chase them .
It also means that games aren &apos;t really going to be as surprising as they could be , because you only get out of it , at least in terms of the character , what you actually put into it .
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run .
So that &apos;s what you see here .
That &apos;s what people want . That &apos;s what we &apos;re giving them .
It was just voted , I think in the Sunday Times , as one of the most impressive stunts .
That &apos;s what we thought was going to come out of this .
It had shattered into pieces .
We &apos;ve had three generations of leaders , in my mind .
Today , Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue , and he employs 70 people full time and another 800 people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most .
You know , I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head , but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet .
Thank you .
That &apos;s often given to the girl .
And none of them are wrong . They &apos;re different .
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound , whereas real heparin , the real ingredient , cost 900 dollars a pound .
Everybody else at the table said , &quot; Folks , that doesn &apos;t cut it .
So what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re not only enlisting the multinationals , we &apos;re giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we &apos;re checking .
Poor people , people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity , the lack of dignity .
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole , geographic North Pole , is that it &apos;s slap bang in the middle of the sea .
Fast forward three years . I did eventually get off the sofa , and start planning another expedition . This time , I wanted to go right across , on my own this time , from Russia , at the top of the map , to the North Pole , where the sort of kink in the middle is , and then on to Canada .
: So it &apos;s day 22 .
You can just see -- there &apos;s a nine and a string of zeros here .
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper .
There was a tent , a letter to the Norwegian king .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
Michael Shermer : The pattern behind self-deception
A Type I error , or false positive , is believing a pattern is real when it &apos;s not .
What do you see here ?
They increase the amount of dopamine .
If you look down here , it &apos;s fine . If you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
You can use -- which I did , went out and did -- Michael Persinger &apos;s God Helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
There is great confusion when the two look at each other .
Power goes into a battery . There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire .
But 280 is the peak .
Particularly in the world of sea ice , the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago , and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with .
And there &apos;s been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there .
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us .
We give them these little pieces of filter paper .
OK ? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone .
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope .
That is , promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed .
Within days the entire incident was forgotten , which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content .
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran , there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft .
And then she said -- grabbed me like that , because my mother was quite big -- and she lifted me up and she says , &quot; How come you &apos;re not at school ? &quot;
Now that is called the Huf Haus .
Gone .
And I &apos;m trying to remove it . And the static is interfering with everything .
And what I normally do is walk &apos; round a room -- -- trying to find one . And then I put it underneath the microscope .
It &apos;s -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle , to shove his feet in .
But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years .
Thank you .
So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .

That &apos;s why I decided , with my new book , to go to every single state of Brazil .
So , five tips : Believe in overnight success , believe someone else has the answers for you , believe that when growth is guaranteed , you should settle down , believe the fault is someone else &apos;s , and believe that only the goals themselves matter .
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics , but not to do these things I talked about .
Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies ?
Don &apos;t argue , do as you &apos;re told .
Most Kenyans did not see the violence .
I &apos;m from Australia . I &apos;m here to help .
Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do ?
He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars .
On the question of is the U.S. containing China , they say , &quot; No , look at the history of the Soviet Union . That was containment . &quot;
So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we &apos;ve been asked to address this evening , which is the future of U.S.-China relations ?
I &apos;m only alive because so long ago , I was helped by generous strangers .
And they then wrote code , usually machine code , sometimes binary code , which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re-punched , in order to verify it .
Dave Isay : Everyone around you has a story the world needs to hear
People treated the experience with incredible respect , and amazing conversations happened inside .
Most of them aren &apos;t .
A dozen years later , Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son &apos;s life .
It &apos;s a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about -- no regrets , nothing left unsaid .
And maybe , just maybe , it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life , every single life , matters equally and infinitely .
The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects , the building block of the visual world .
In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model , it has 24 million nodes , 140 million parameters , Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
What the computer doesn &apos;t see is that this is a special Italian cake that &apos;s only served during Easter time .
And that was our challenge .
There it is . That &apos;s great .
In an article in the magazine Redbook titled &quot; You : PMS Free , &quot; readers were informed that between 80 to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS .
The questions is , why hasn &apos;t this information trickled down to the public ?
In 2013 , Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue .
We need to find better ways to remember them .
I was trying not to think , I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot .
And we talked until the last song on the tape .
It was a short meeting .
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law .
Linda Hill : How to manage for collective creativity
He did so reluctantly , because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups .
It &apos;s about discovery-driven learning where you act , as opposed to plan , your way to the future .
Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again ?
&quot; I &apos;m a role model , I &apos;m a human glue , I &apos;m a connector , I &apos;m an aggregator of viewpoints .
New York state is one of only two in the U.S .
I didn &apos;t even respond .
The conversations used to sound something like this : &quot; Oh , when I hit the street , my brother got this connection for this , that and the third , &quot; or , &quot; My man over here got this connection for the low price .
This is us . We are one .
So Sangu , of course , this is strong rhetoric .
I certainly could not .
They simply threw everything at us .
If you want to change the world , it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side .
And I believe there is .
But even better than this is that every day between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. , free of charge , the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers , and these guys basically know the answers to everything .
We have done the first step with ProtonMail , but this is really just the first step in a very , very long journey .
We had this group there that was dedicated , three full-time guards , that was dedicated to go and stop it , but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest .
On the very second day , it picked up illegal chainsaw noises .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript : Small coincidences . They happen all the time and yet , they pass us by because we are not looking for them . In a delightfully subtle trick , magician Helder Guimarães demonstrates with a deck of cards , a dollar bill and a stuffed giraffe .
Secrets are important .
And the first number I thought of was ...
Do you have it ? Perfect .
I have some cards that maybe , maybe they don &apos;t mean anything .
Cancer ? Heart attacks ? Diabetes ?
Thankfully , I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology , which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin-sized battery .
It &apos;s a very crowded thing that we do .
And so if they don &apos;t have 70 , 80 percent of a grade , they don &apos;t stay , which is probably the reason why I haven &apos;t been CEO for more than 10 years .
But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete .
And follow this all the time and we know how they &apos;re doing and we say , you &apos;re not interested in this now , let &apos;s wait a year .
No , we &apos;ve been to the beaches , so we &apos;ve been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique , so that &apos;s done .
So that &apos;s the key thing ?
So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED .
They only eat milkweed as larvae .
What I think is important , though , is to move beyond these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit , these simple animals , these insects that we tend to think of as very , very simple with tiny little brains .
So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes , and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes .
And the practice is really pretty simple .
People were turning on the healthcare workers who had come , the heroes who had come to try and help save the community , to help work with the community , and they were unable to access them .
Now the virus was in that environment .
And then we &apos;ve got to be able to have systems that can find every single case , every contact of those cases , and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission .
And the other risk , of course , is when you &apos;ve been working so hard for so long , and slept so few hours over the past months , people are tired , people become fatigued , and these new risks start to creep into the response .
An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture , and that one too went viral , and since then , people call Turkish media the penguin media . But this time , people knew what to do .
So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night , secretly .
With that many meetings every day , with tea offered at every one of them , which he could not refuse , because that would be rude , he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea , because that would be many kilos of sugar , he can &apos;t even calculate how many kilos , and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast .
Khadija Gbla : My mother &apos;s strange definition of empowerment
I &apos;m standing there thinking , &quot; This is very confusing . I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot;
No , I was the only person with a bit of a color on me .
It was in your best interest .
Are they your new friends , Khadija ? &quot;
And once again -- FGM is like the gift that keeps giving .
It &apos;s saying that women don &apos;t have a right to sexual pleasure .
When John Chapin and I , 15 years ago , proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface , meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices , no matter how far they are from their own bodies , just by imagining what they want to do , our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help , of the psychiatry variety .
The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever , Alberto Santos Dumont , who , on October 19 , 1901 , created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see .
The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel , in real time .
In one pulse , the subject saw something .
The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
Forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in Latin America , 13 in Brazil , and the most dangerous of all , it &apos;s San Pedro Sula , Honduras &apos; second city , with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people .
Same for most Western European cities .
One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones , kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices , of what works and what doesn &apos;t .
I &apos;m actually just a survivor , and these photographs that I &apos;m showing you here are dangerous .
And 1,000 kilometers away from the safety of land , disaster strikes .
And there is a very simple solution .
And since we are in South America , let &apos;s go to Lima in Peru , a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year .
So the conventional business model in the West is more for more .
This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way .
&quot; Save the rainforest &quot; is an environmental slogan as old as time — but Tasso Azevedo catches us up on how the fight is actually going these days . Spurred by the jaw-dropping losses of the 1990s , new laws are helping slow the rate of deforestation in Brazil . Is it enough ? Not yet . He has five ideas about what we should do next . And he asks if the lessons learned in Brazil could be applied to an even bigger problem : global climate change .
And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department , we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation , and make a plan to combat that at a national level , involving the local governments , the civil society , business , local communities , in an effort that could tackle those causes .
But also , forests can be a big part of the solution since that &apos;s the best way we know to sink , capture and store carbon .
That &apos;s what we proved when we decreased deforestation .
So I just took a short clip from &quot; Batman Begins &quot; here And you know , presumably he &apos;s wearing makeup , the lighting here is kind of challenging , but still , just from the video , we &apos;re able to extract his pulse and show it quite well .
And you know it &apos;s not real science unless you use guinea pigs , and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany , and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion-magnified .
I call it the visual microphone .
So they say something like , &quot; Because grammar ! &quot;
The first way is the simplest way .
They can be really good words of English .
Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error .
So let &apos;s talk about equality .
Sometimes , it &apos;s almost creepy .
Imagine how long it would have taken before : dozens of people , many years .
In this pathology case , the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis .
You can see we now have 62 percent of our 1.5 million images classified correctly .
I know that when I often tell people about this situation , people can be quite dismissive .
We need real people .
Yes , I &apos;m going to recommit to that .
My dad is a black guy . You see what I &apos;m saying ?
&quot; Uncle Joe is racist . &quot;
Mounted on roads or on police cars , Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
Even the elections this past week passed without much drama .
TH : And now we thought , yes , we have a brilliant program .
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen .
You can see the famous Trollfjord and a day after , all-time high for NRK2 .
But this is Slow TV , so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach , and then you keep it a little bit longer , and when you keep it that long , I &apos;m sure some of you now have noticed the cow .
And there was blood all over the pavements .
But we have a few problems .
He was sent very far away , and she was left behind .
Some of them were notes saying , get out .
That means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany .
By 2030 , we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies , including three out of the four BRIC countries .
To find out , this year we conducted a global survey among more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries .

It took me a while , but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank and had to spend time in jail .
He &apos;s a filmmaker and an activist .
I want to give you one example .
But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past .
In many a piece of music , it &apos;s the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape .
And in an age of distraction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
So how is that possible ?
Based on feedback that we gave them , some of our participants told us they &apos;re not motivated to exercise any more .
It did .
People often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else , but I know so many autistic people who love being creative .
But if you think about it , what is normal ?
You have the canopy , you have the understory , and you have the forest floor .
I don &apos;t feel this is my mission in life . &quot;
Six months after diagnosis , Pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy .
And that was on July 27th .
They had a clinical trial for a drug that they &apos;ve been developing .
And the third thing , and last but not least gift that my son has given me , as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August 2014 : That girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife , and Pete and Julie have given me my granddaughter , Lucy Fitzgerald Frates .
From Tomi Lebrero to many other places and musicians around the world .
Maybe a few more extracts now .
The man who is going to appear onstage momentarily , and Vincent &apos;s going to introduce him , is one of the subjects of one of his past videos .
And it was : We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer , cancer that by then had spread to her lungs , her bones , and her brain .
Let me ask you differently : If hiding isn &apos;t the answer , what if we did the opposite ?
I have loans and mortgages .
My mother fought her cancer for eight years .

Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain , increase our energy , socialize , even commune with God .
I mean , don &apos;t forget , Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900 , and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca-Cola is today .
What are you doing right ? &quot;
Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down , all measured in GDP .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you .
The second thing to notice is that for poor countries , the curve is really steep .
Thank you .
One is , we can make better use of the oil that we have , and that &apos;s analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics , and we can do this in a number of ways that we &apos;ll talk about in a second , but the other option is the &quot; drill , baby , drill &quot; option , which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibiotics .
Now , there are backstop options , which is other alternative technologies that people are working on .
Where we &apos;re from , in Holland , We even have rules for how to follow the rules .
And this image somehow went all over the world .
Let &apos;s start with the global challenge of urbanization .
It is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .
So why can &apos;t we have a concrete defense ?
Fifty-four percent of the world &apos;s population lives in our cities .
Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity , honesty , and social and civic participation . So how do we start building cities that make us care ?
The plan was to hand it over to a developer , who planned to turn it into a construction site .
So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history .
Now , we &apos;re familiar with all of these models .
And remember that in the 20th century , this was not at all true .
I would argue no .
Humanity takes center stage at TED , but I would like to add a voice for the animals , whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us .
So in a single image , you can really see the scale of this event — just the number of people , the colors , the banners .
That &apos;s kind of the way you communicate .
It &apos;s usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders , and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan , where there &apos;s deep-seated resentment against the formal system .
And most importantly , the engagement was terminated and Naghma was free .
She was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother .
she lies on her back , she is strapped down to the table , and the table is rotated at high speed .
It &apos;s very difficult , numerically , to win a prize if you want to .
and she explained that she grew up in Ukraine .
It was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander , to explore , to understand more about this oceanic final frontier .
But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can &apos;t capture , or in this case , a fish throwing up grains of sand .
And there are so many different ways it &apos;s a complex kind of a query .
And this means teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal from 30 yards , because something that happens after something doesn &apos;t mean it happened because of it , necessarily , and if you &apos;ll let me geek out on you for a second , the Romans called this &quot; post hoc ergo propter hoc , &quot; after which therefore because of which .
Literally , &quot; walled-in-alive disease . &quot;
I don &apos;t .
He took his high school diploma , and later he told me why .
Shouldn &apos;t this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake , the societies in exile , the refugees ?
And this is when her face turned blank , and she said to me , &quot; I have no future .
She never smoked a cigarette , she never drank alcohol , and she had been playing sports for almost half her life .
This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time .
We &apos;ve found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain &apos;s most basic needs , a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body .
And what &apos;s amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells .
Over the last 16 months , as I &apos;ve debated this issue around the world , every single time somebody has said to me , &quot; I don &apos;t really worry about invasions of privacy because I don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
Even if you &apos;re somebody who decides that you never want to , the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power — dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others — is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve .
But I almost didn &apos;t go to college until an aunt offered financial help .
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care .
So , what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home ?
Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate .
And last but not least , the language of the system — it &apos;s incredibly cryptic .
Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences , one on top of each other , but that our healthy and robust public debate should be , once again , one of its fundamental values .
Thank you .
Okay ? So this is the total value of wealth relative to income , and you can see that in particular in Europe , we are almost back to the pre-World War I level .
And then , in the postwar period , you had unusually high growth rate , partly due to the reconstruction .
And even five years ago , many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in Switzerland , that Switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world , and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions against Swiss banks for a big change to happen , and now we are moving toward more financial transparency .
Daria van den Bercken : Why I take the piano on the road … and in the air
To give you a feel for this idea , imagine the following scenario : You walk into your child &apos;s day care center .
What it shows is that region right there , that little blob , it &apos;s about the size of an olive and it &apos;s on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there .
That was a trip .
But importantly , I don &apos;t think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function , even mental functions that may be critical for survival .
I want to tell you how 20,000 remarkable young people from over 100 countries ended up in Cuba and are transforming health in their communities .
So Spanish became part of the pre-pre-med curriculum .
The pain .
You &apos;re doing everything right at work , taking all the right advice , but you &apos;re just not moving up . Why ? Susan Colantuono shares a simple , surprising piece of advice you might not have heard before quite so plainly . This talk , while aimed at an audience of women , has universal takeaways -- for men and women , new grads and midcareer workers .
So this is obvious , right ?
Tonya emailed me two months ago , and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position , and during the interview , they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry , and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the chief information officer at her company .
He &apos;s got a face mask on , but no shirt .
We traveled the country .
And in the last two or three years , we &apos;ve actually been , for the first time , realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real-life projects across Asia .
By the time I managed to open my eyes , I had documented this moment .
Big data is important , and big data is new , and when you think about it , the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges — to feed people , supply them with medical care , supply them with energy , electricity , and to make sure they &apos;re not burnt to a crisp because of global warming — is because of the effective use of data .
Well , think about it .
It will improve our lives , but there are problems that we need to be conscious of , and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions , that the police may use big data for their purposes , a little bit like &quot; Minority Report . &quot;
We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries .
We risk temperatures we haven &apos;t seen between human beings and the planet .
But we have to invest . We have to invest in our cities , and we have to invest wisely , and if we do , we &apos;ll see cleaner cities , quieter cities , safer cities , more attractive cities , more productive cities , and stronger community in those cities — public transport , recycling , reusing , all sorts of things that bring communities together .
I don &apos;t have to list all those things to an audience like this , but you can see the electric cars , you can see the batteries using new materials .
I am trying , or will try to convey this inspiration .
So , in a typical sunny day in the Amazon , a big tree manages to transfer 1,000 liters of water through its transpiration — 1,000 liters .
Here it is , pulsing .
If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea , evaporation &apos;s greater on the sea , and it sucks the air above the desert .
He replied : &quot; The spirit of the forest told us . &quot;
All invisible .
But all of that is about to change with 3D printing , and it all started with this , the very first part that was ever printed .
What if we could , for the first time , make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here , that are edible ?
About the evolution of our universe .
So what does this tell us ?
Well , imagine if I gave you a pair of dice , and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair .
In 1900 , there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters : floods , earthquakes , volcanic eruption , whatever , droughts .
Well , it &apos;s very clear that poverty here was almost halved , and in U.S. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
What shall we do about this , Ola ?
So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance .
Okay ? If you feel unsure , go for &quot; the most people are in the middle . &quot;
That &apos;s nice . So what &apos;s going to happen next ?
This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan , and it was open between 1908 and 1948 , just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area .
A forest planted by humans , then left to nature &apos;s own devices , typically takes at least 100 years to mature . But what if we could make the process happen ten times faster ? In this short talk , eco-entrepreneur Shubhendu Sharma explains how to create a mini-forest ecosystem anywhere .
Author Isabel Allende is 71 . Yes , she has a few wrinkles — but she has incredible perspective too . In this candid talk , meant for viewers of all ages , she talks about her fears as she gets older and shares how she plans to keep on living passionately .
I feel lighter .
It doesn &apos;t always work , but you cannot blame me for trying .
So throughout my life , I &apos;ve seen women — family , friends , colleagues — live through these experiences , and they seldom talk about it .
When I reported about these events , I felt I had charge , I felt like I had a channel to release all the emotions I had inside me .
I feared to judge because I didn &apos;t know what it would be if I didn &apos;t support the same view as this girl .
A couple of weeks later , the International Monetary Fund visited us , and asked my minister , &quot; Minister , it &apos;s great that you want to help farmers reach food security , but what if it doesn &apos;t rain ? &quot;
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow , with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans taking up insurance in 2012 , and half of that number is in one country , South Africa .
And my theme was this : Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries , but this one is special — it &apos;s the first where one species , ours , has the planet &apos;s future in its hands .
It is five billion years before the sun flares up , and the universe may go on forever , so post-human evolution , here on Earth and far beyond , could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that &apos;s led to us , and even more wonderful .
These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
Many of us think that we can &apos;t know what another animal is thinking , and that is true , but any of you in relationships — at least this is my case — just because you ask someone that you &apos;re with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn &apos;t mean that they can tell you .
I do not think that canine PTSD is the same as human PTSD .
Anthropomorphizing well , however , I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other animals &apos; minds and experiences , and there &apos;s actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well , and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry .
Thank you .
And of course what she does is important .
Tim Berners-Lee : A Magna Carta for the web
We can tweet , and oh , lots and lots of people can see our tweets , except when they can &apos;t , except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country , or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves , the state of the country we live in , which isn &apos;t available to anybody else .
In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences , I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class , which every student signs at the beginning of the year : read critically , write consciously , speak clearly , tell your truth .
And I believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power .
who believe that the cure-all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data , more transparency .
Indeed , power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city .
We get the people for whom nothing else has worked , people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets .
Disturbances died down in the general population .
It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated .
So I took that question back to the deep end , where some of our most violent offenders are housed .
And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity , prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy .
Wake up . It cannot last .
Only a thriving middle class can do that .
That &apos;s good for it , despite what some restaurateurs may tell you .
Talithia Williams : Own your body &apos;s data
And then he looks at me and looks at Donald , and he goes , about one in 1,000 .
Here &apos;s a chart that we had about three or four years ago .
And I &apos;m thinking , how do you calm down ? But I don &apos;t think he &apos;s having a heart attack .
Audience : Show me the data ! Talithia Williams : I can &apos;t hear you !
If I &apos;m going to use the word &quot; Wednesday &quot; in a sentence , and I &apos;m coming up to the word , and I can feel that I &apos;m going to stutter or something , I can change the word to &quot; tomorrow , &quot; or &quot; the day after Tuesday , &quot; or something else .
I &apos;m talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend .
He really thought there was something else going on and he was right , because when he looked through a bunch of the cases , he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves .
But people were very attached to the five-star rating system .
Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood ?
Heather Barnett : What humans can learn from semi-intelligent slime
It doesn &apos;t like it dry .
So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do , and they design their own petri dish experiment , an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties .

This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures , some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor .
And I said , &quot; Excuse me ? &quot; And then I looked it up and they do drill into people &apos;s brains .
When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue , the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall .

So as you can see , we are always solving .
And why don &apos;t you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me .
That one &apos;s my favorite .
My wife and family were in Japan , and as the news started to come in , I was panicking .
But we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us .
This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering , pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies .
So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs , and based on this , you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess , you could sit on the chair , you could eat the apple , the dog will bark .
And to explore this , he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents .
One avenue is to appeal to people &apos;s emotional responses , to appeal to people &apos;s empathy , and we often do that through stories .
And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world &apos;s religions , in all of the different versions of the golden rule , and in all of the world &apos;s moral philosophies , which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view .
They &apos;re the reason you have electricity , heat , clean water , food .
It seemed to be about right , but I couldn &apos;t quite tell .
So I started looking at the binary information , and I asked myself , what do I do when I first encounter something like this ?
But that &apos;s not enough to blow up a battery .
What I &apos;d like to suggest , there are a number of habits that we need to move away from .
I &apos;m not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head .
Go and get a voice coach .
Now we &apos;re going to warm up our lips , And now , brrrrrrrrrr , just like when you were a kid .
Now entropy is a complicated term , but basically it measures the strength of passwords .
So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using , or that we could find information about in the research literature .
Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words .
And this quilt has the 1,000 most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website .
The actual events are pretty straightforward .
Prior to going to prison , I didn &apos;t know that there were so many brilliant black poets , authors and philosophers , and then I had the great fortune of encountering Malcolm X &apos;s autobiography , and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself .
I had to apologize to the people I had hurt .
It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl .
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer , and as I discovered , lawyering didn &apos;t quite fit .
We unwittingly assume that values like justice , beauty , kindness , are akin to scientific quantities , like length , mass and weight .
You might say that we become the authors of our own lives .
Before I go any further , let me clarify my role in all of this .
But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable , such as &quot; app &quot; and &quot; e &quot; as a prefix , and &quot; google &quot; as a verb .
If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries , you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel .
If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means , it &apos;s real .
If A is the question , and B is the answer , then research is a direct path .
We call them network motifs , and they &apos;re the elementary circuits that help us understand the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms , including our body .
Will Potter : The shocking move to criminalize nonviolent protest
Thank you .
This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office .
They grab the spotlight for causes they support , forcing us to take note , acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be .
To me , that represents hope .
Now , there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement , but the first one we &apos;re going to start with is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott .
I did go on to make that film .
African-Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded .
They can run upside down very rapidly on rods , branches and wires , and if you perturb one of those branches , They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet .
Ray Kurzweil : Get ready for hybrid thinking
The amount of data we &apos;re getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year .
Five to 10 years from now , search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding , reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books .
I &apos;d watch those same men walking back home every night .
Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease .
the answer is not really .
The project that we &apos;re working on is called &quot; The Resilience Project : A Search for Unexpected Heroes , &quot; because what we are interested in doing is saying , can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective factors ?
We delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease , for the treatment of our disease , to anointed experts .
Jon Mooallem : How the teddy bear taught us compassion
in a commercial for Purina . Americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much , much stupider .
They were going to be serving him a Southern specialty , a delicacy , really , called possum and taters .
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then .
They fought . The worked .
Statistically , you are safer as a teenage boy , you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do , statistically .
He missed , in some ways , the opposite of killing .
Frankly , I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive , and they were going to help with that , and I joined the Army because it was what I knew , and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well .
I received the scholarship to go overseas and to go study and live overseas , and I was living in England and that was interesting , but at the same time , the same people who I was training with , the same soldiers that I went through all my training with , and we prepared for war , they were now actually heading over to it .
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences .
But over time , I &apos;ve come to feel that the truth is irrelevant .
Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison , and they had walked in with their heads held high , and they walked out with their heads still held high , many years later .
Identity politics can be narcissistic .
I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families , but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh , and gay families so exhilaratingly new , and I found meaning in that surprise .
Rives : My roommates would have the TV on , and this would happen .
Those were all really solid examples .
Literature probably shows it best .
You can click on that red &quot; refresh &quot; button .
&quot; Pheromone &quot; is a very powerful word .
So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom .
When they &apos;re secreted from the glands , the molecules are odorless .
It appears that the more secretions she &apos;s got , the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly .
And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis , the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars just in the household sector , that cost us 10 million jobs , was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud , particularly using this recipe .
It expanded remarkably as well .
And so the FBI , under the leadership of an attorney general who is African-American and a president of the United States who is African-American , have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis , in which it is the first virgin crisis in history , conceived without sin in the executive ranks .
Two D.J. decks .
That &apos;s the major thread .
We &apos;re getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing , and all of a sudden everyone &apos;s taking these massive &apos; 80s tunes like Bowie , &quot; Let &apos;s Dance , &quot; and all these disco records , and just rapping on them .
This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles , plasma inside , centered on the pitcher &apos;s mound , and that would move away from the pitcher &apos;s mound slightly faster than the ball .
You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post .
EDI , EDI .
Much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels , we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends .
Harold and I arrive in New York .
There &apos;s no question about it .
He says , if you &apos;re trying to solve a really hard problem , really hard , that you should have a diverse group of people , including those with diverse intellects .
Thank you .
Because I &apos;m Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really , I don &apos;t know , I just need to say that .
But I &apos;m just saying , if y &apos;all are interested in the top five songs , you need to holler at me .
As far as I &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s about the love .
That is what I am trying to say .
Okay , well if you think about how you can calculate these things , you can take what you can see , okay , I &apos;m going to chop it up and that &apos;s the result of physics , right ?
And you get something like this .
How does pollution , which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe , how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface ?
Eighty percent of them are living in low-income countries such as Kenya , and the absolute majority do not need to be blind .
What &apos;s more , we &apos;ve learned that this is something that we haven &apos;t built just for the community but with the community .
That &apos;s the entire finish of the race .
Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until 1996 , when it was set at 35 miles , 1,531 feet , nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972 .
So in sports where large size is prized , the large athletes have gotten larger .
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health , but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra-endurance : no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running ; narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames ; large surface area of joints for shock absorption .
Has that number been increasing dramatically over time ?
Well , how genetic is it ?
In this particular child , you can see , it &apos;s not making good eye contact .
I mean , our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects .
And when we do , the results will often surprise .
So this is what I call a &quot; don &apos;t eat me &quot; wetsuit .
Well , to my mind , rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention , we &apos;ve paid attention to the biological evidence , we &apos;ve put importance to the human anecdotal evidence , and we &apos;ve used science as a tool for translation , translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind .
That &apos;s all . Zuzana wanted hers to look like that .
Designed for the phone books , as I said , to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high-speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack .
I persevered .
Well , there was no best , so the designer &apos;s judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad .
I want to take that of an Earth-like planet about another star .
It &apos;s a terrible shadow . And we can &apos;t see planets .
I think this is the coolest possible science .
And I subsequently learned from the many adults -- I took care of about 200 adults — I learned from them that if I didn &apos;t look , peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room , I would never be able to guess better than chance whether they were gay , straight , bi , or asexual in their affirmed gender .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
If they see me , they &apos;ll understand why I &apos;m no threat in the lady &apos;s room , but I can be threatened in the men &apos;s room . &quot;
There was , in fact , a paper of just this very name , &quot; Parenthood as Crisis , &quot; published in 1957 , and in the 50-plus years since , there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish .
This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding .
Either way , by the way , if you think it &apos;s hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles , just imagine what it &apos;s like now for non-traditional families : families with two dads , families with two moms , single-parent households .
I whispered it into his ear .
And Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other .
Mark Kelly : Yeah , it &apos;s amazing , it &apos;s amazing how everything can change for any of us in an instant .
PM : Gabby , are you optimistic about your continuing recovery -- walking , talking , being able to move your arm and leg ?
PM : Gabby , what did make you want to marry Mark ?
A very controversial vote , but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time .
This issue , like many others , has become very polarizing and political , and we &apos;re trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington .
As my family and I ran for safety when I was about 12 from one of those attacks , I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had .
And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere , pulsing with lightning , crowned by the aurora borealis .
Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives .
So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education , that we could focus on content , and that &apos;s fine , and we could focus on theories , and that &apos;s fine , but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing .
I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather , so I knew that places like Paley Park didn &apos;t happen by accident .
But design is not just how something looks , it &apos;s how your body feels on that seat in that space , and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience .
Now the zoning here was massive , so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts , and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans .
But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple , and it &apos;s even harder to keep them that way .
Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions -- I don &apos;t know what that means , but it &apos;s what it says on Wikipedia — there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error , and the probability was one out of every 360 billion calculations .
So I was a little put off by this .
We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics .
Now I &apos;ve asked you .
And among those was liking a page for curly fries . Curly fries are delicious , but liking them does not necessarily mean that you &apos;re smarter than the average person .
It &apos;s doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place .
So that was &apos; 93 , and it was &apos; 97 , really , before the foundation itself started .
That &apos;s down to a few hundred thousand .
MG : Yeah . I think actually , for the foundation employees , there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming .
It took three more years to get it than we expected , and then there was no way it was going to get out there .
We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing .
It seems to me , it &apos;s actually really hard for some people to figure out on something else .
Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone .
That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors , and even then , we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate .
Ed Yong : Zombie roaches and other parasite tales
Because after all , they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre .
Now I would argue that , once stung , the cockroach isn &apos;t a roach anymore .
Now typically , this doesn &apos;t lead to any overt illness .
I learned about engineering and how things worked , not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices .
To build the Pantheon took some miracles .
Well , putting a man on the moon was a good one , and returning him safely to Earth wasn &apos;t bad either .
The various needs of personal navigation systems , in-car navigation systems , and web-based maps address this .
We appreciate you joining us .
And so if I &apos;m going to pursue them , I need to have the capability to go after them , and again , the controls are in how I apply that capability , not that I have the capability itself .
Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security , and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they &apos;re operating in Russia or the U.K .
What metadata lets you do is connect that .
One is , the reason that there hasn &apos;t been a major attack in the United States since 9 / 11 , that is not an accident .
We have a great track record of that , and we &apos;re actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them .
Go Dallas .
So , what exactly does Global Witness do ?
So , here &apos;s one , but there are plenty of others to choose from .
Why should tax evaders , corrupt government officials , arms traders and more , be able to hide their identities from us , the public ?
Together , let &apos;s kickstart this global movement .
But why would we take that risk ?
Spider webs like this , it doesn &apos;t build those , it builds them down in the corners .
This is our spaceship , the Soyuz , that little one .
And if there was a neurological cause , could we find a cure ?
At the age of 12 months , most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others .
Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they &apos;ve got a faulty amygdala .
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity .
And I &apos;m trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
Okay . Pretty much everybody .
You &apos;ve known these people your entire life .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
But that &apos;s just an example .
Well , the really cool thing is that most CEOs are .
Hesta .
Now a fair question might be , what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated , overstated , it &apos;s not urgent , something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice ?
It is seldom , if ever , extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government , to the notion that honesty , accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed , participatory democracy .
The media have to decide : Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform ?
In fact , it &apos;s a little different , and to explain , I need to tell you a short story about myself .
Simple , individual rules .
In fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
Education really hasn &apos;t changed in the past 500 years .
It &apos;s got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
So there , the students would , again , the instructors flipped the classroom , blended online and in person , and the results were staggering .
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark .
We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi , 20 dollars .
Let &apos;s take an example .
The hard : In banks , when there is a problem between the back office and the front office , they don &apos;t cooperate . What is the solution ?
You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate , to move out of insulation .
&quot; You know , I am a virgin , &quot; she told me .
Not so for women , who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night -- that is , to turn up with your hymen intact .
But in fact , they come from a 10th-century Arabic book called &quot; The Encyclopedia of Pleasure , &quot; which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia , and everything in between .
Philosopher Stephen Cave begins with a dark but compelling question : When did you first realize you were going to die ? And even more interesting : Why do we humans so often resist the inevitability of death ? Cave explores four narratives -- common across civilizations -- that we tell ourselves &quot; in order to help us manage the terror of death . &quot;
You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects , and you remind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you compare their behavior .
But for others , the whole idea of resurrection , of climbing out of the grave , it &apos;s just too much like a bad zombie movie .
And you needn &apos;t worry how long the book is , or whether it &apos;s a comic strip or an epic .
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse .
Even now , Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard , hidden away , just waiting to be found .
Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique .
As it bites the second time , I kick .
It looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
PM : And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . BV : Oh , thank you .
For example , this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China , except for one line in Beijing , at a fraction of the cost .
Cars have been here for really less than 100 years .
What are our forests really made of ? From the air , ecologist Greg Asner uses a spectrometer and high-powered lasers to map nature in meticulous kaleidoscopic 3D detail -- what he calls &quot; a very high-tech accounting system &quot; of carbon . In this fascinating talk , Asner gives a clear message : To save our ecosystems , we need more data , gathered in new ways .
So our imagery is 3D , it &apos;s chemical , it &apos;s biological , and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy , but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest .
Temperatures are increasing , and what &apos;s really happening is we &apos;re getting a lot of droughts , recurring droughts .
Or , how to deal with a large species like elephants , which may , if their populations get too large , have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
Okay , on the count of three , you &apos;re going to go .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love , then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity .
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia &apos;s white-table-cloth , extremely expensive restaurants .
I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children , but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do , so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three , and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it .
And also quantitative data , so what was the average length of their profile , how much time was spent between messages ?
It was enough for a date .
So finally , to break the deadlock , the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor , and he calls out and he says to the Israelites , &quot; Send your mightiest warrior down , and we &apos;ll have this out , just the two of us . &quot;
There &apos;s heavy infantry , which are foot soldiers , armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor .
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat .
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe .
And you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
So I tried to think what I could use for here , and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music .
So I got about 10 credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy , really , and bought myself this huge printing press , which I had no idea how to use at all .
Okay . Thanks .
That is , he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul , to put down the whole story as a pious fable .
It &apos;s fanaticism , and we have to stop confusing the two .
So the understanding of this Great Recession was that this was completely surprising , this came out of the blue , this was like the wrath of the gods .
From seven months of pregnancy , a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus toward the instability , giving birth to the baby , the dragon-king .
It was not a prediction . &quot;
But I will in the end urge you to rethink , actually take risks , and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy .
But time we didn &apos;t get .
I said , &quot; We need to , before we restore confidence in the markets , we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people . &quot;
Europe of and by the people , a Europe , an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders .
So , how did it just do that ?
And that &apos;s why you don &apos;t need to model the glass .
In fact , when fully extended , this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch .
Sergei Lupashin , Mark Muller and Robin Ritz .
But that &apos;s kind of a big problem .
And this guy is another guy I admire a lot , and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer .
And the open grassland savannas of North America opened up , leading to the Columbian mammoth , a large , hairless species in North America .
It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth .
And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence , how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men .
Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys ?
What about all those boys ?
In the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
But there &apos;s so many men who care deeply about these issues , but caring deeply is not enough .
So here &apos;s a story .
And they &apos;re distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities .
I hope next time you see it , you won &apos;t even be able to see the map .
Here &apos;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream , and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together .
The metal in the sink is conductive .
Hover the mouse over the &quot; take a photo &quot; button , and you &apos;ve got a little cat photo booth .
Thank you .
But if growth slows down , instead of doubling our standard of living every generation , Americans in the future can &apos;t expect to be twice as well off as their parents , or even a quarter &#91; more well off than &#93; their parents .
We had the vertical city , the invention of the elevator .
It &apos;s amazing . The mainframe computer was invented in 1942 .
And when things work well , then the nervous system works well , and everything functions .
There are eight children in the family .
Anybody interested in that ?
One of the most exciting things about this is that , indeed , it involves multidisciplinary work .
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge .
You &apos;ve been working on this solar company SolarCity .
But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power .
EM : Well , we &apos;ve made significant advances in the technology of the airframe , the engines , the electronics and the launch operation .
These projects are so -- Paypal , SolarCity , Tesla , SpaceX , they &apos;re so spectacularly different , they &apos;re such ambitious projects at scale .
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it .
TV . Oh my God .
and then that &apos;s basically all the problems solved .
&#91; Chatrooms and Children &#93; I &apos;m very proud of that picture , that &apos;s my son playing in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig , I believe you call it , where he got paid .
That &apos;s what she should have said .
That message is meaningless if you don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a trader at the bank .
But nothing else .
So the technology already exists .
Turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly .
Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics , the opening ceremonies ?
Contrast that , for a moment , with the traditional method of using a conveyor .
What makes you , you ? Is it how you think of yourself , how others think of you , or something else entirely ? In this talk , Julian Baggini draws from philosophy and neuroscience to give a surprising answer . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I don &apos;t know whether this number plate , which says &quot; messiah 1 , &quot; indicates that the driver believes in the messiah , or that they are the messiah .
I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water , and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms , and that &apos;s what water is .
These are the Iguazu Falls , in Argentina .
But before I do that , we have to go over the definition of what green is , &apos; cause a lot of us have a different definition of it .
There &apos;s two types of algae growing .
And lastly , it &apos;s me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work , I don &apos;t just talk about what I do .
Over the last two years we &apos;ve had 35 different students from around the world working at GreenLab .
And I was led to it through a series of events .
Sounds ridiculous , right .
And that &apos;s huge .
So Julie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her asthma .
That &apos;s the question that changed my life forever .
I did a year of research , still couldn &apos;t figure out what kind of legs to use , couldn &apos;t find any resources that could help me .
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside .
We went through several wars during my time in New York .
And it was a very , very uncomfortable , unpleasant feeling .
They were not allowed diplomats .
States mean less than they used to , and the power of the state is declining .
And of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything .
The Mesopotamian culture : we invent agriculture , we domesticate animals and plants .
So we have to ask ourselves : are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state ?
We have to invest in transformations capability , moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis , and of course to adapt to unavoidable change .
So , there is scientific evidence .
The first , obviously , is the world &apos;s free time and talents .
They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension , which is pick-up time .
Ushahidi , by contrast , It &apos;s value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .
When we find a match , we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down .
YouTube &apos;s Content ID system addresses all of these cases .
Actually , I kind of divide the world into two groups now .
The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . &quot;
Everybody who &apos;s spoken at TED has told us implicitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it &apos;s organic .
They &apos;re three .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback .
And I want to just show you a little bit about why .
This is one of the plights of penguins : oil pollution .
The same thing &apos;s true for penguins as well .
She &apos;s really rushing back , because it &apos;s hot , to try to feed her chicks .
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
Well , I hate to break it to you , those aren &apos;t other body parts controlling your behavior .
He could have said , &quot; That &apos;s an amazing discovery , guys , and I will improve upon your technology , &quot; but he didn &apos;t .
They were extremely well-funded .
And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world .
But , some researchers , myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative .
Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today .
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this . Right ?
The first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
I can &apos;t stop this from happening .
We &apos;re going to figure something out for the next 10 years , and try it .
And I think the reason this image works , again , is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer .
And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful .
The most difficult things to X-ray , the most technically challenging things to X-ray are the lightest things , the most delicate things .
If you look at this , just the tube , it is quite bright .
Is that an idea that you believe in , and how would you define that ?
And I would say that national interest and , if you like , what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do , in the long run , come together .
You can &apos;t deal with the economic and financial problem .
Japan has made an announcement .
The bronze is nice hard , durable material that could roll on the ground .
And then the Moon in the center , and it &apos;s floating . And this is in France .
I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites .
Okay . Thank you .
And when I was at Stanford , I found myself , my senior year , chemical engineering major , half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major , which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things , and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes , logic classes , nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , and also producing and choreographing a dance production , and I had to do the lighting and the design work , and I was trying to figure out , do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer , or do I go to medical school ?
But it would really be foolish to choose either one , right ?
No , we shouldn &apos;t measure , we shouldn &apos;t use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it .
Now , depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb , it can cause death or injury . You have to be as far as 50 yards away to escape that .
How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools ?
These are just the ESPN SportsCenter They lose the strategy .
And so , in conclusion , I &apos;ve talked about what seems the future of war , but notice that I &apos;ve only used real world examples and you &apos;ve only seen real world pictures and videos .
And as a result of Voice Over IP -- I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet -- land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years .
We &apos;re putting it in our homes for them !
Oh . Where are you calling from ?
You can say &quot; Weather , &quot; and the name of the city you &apos;re going to travel to .
Who won the 1958 World Series ?
Sorry . I &apos;m not bitter .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ve got to take this . &quot;
Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones . &quot;
It proposes a restaurant .
I want to say , &quot; Look -- now I &apos;m cool &quot; I stood in line and I &apos;ll get mine .
Well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
We should retain those people .
They &apos;re deeply engaged in making teaching better .
And I thought it was so fantastic .
That &apos;s because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness , which is rare , but more comfortable to endorse solemnity , which is commonplace .
I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest , most boring , most fascistic , really repressive typeface , and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica .
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time .
And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor , so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense .
And this is the bridge they &apos;re actually painting up and preparing as we speak .
So , I &apos;m plugging along here -- and I &apos;m just going to have to blow up the staircase .
So I just wanted to let you know , it &apos;s not actually coming out , just the concept is .
ZK : It &apos;s Steve . All right Steve , now , follow me .
Taking it a little further , if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet , and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table , so that way on a windy day it wouldn &apos;t blow away .
ZK : This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing .
It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
And if there is a struggle for life , such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can &apos;t be doubted , I &apos;ve read Malthus and I &apos;ve calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted , and so on and so on .
And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes , and so he said , &quot; Is there another replicator out there on the planet ? &quot;
There &apos;s one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy .
Copying with variation and selection .
In 1961 , Frank Drake made his famous equation , but I think he concentrated on the wrong things .
Do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
The second , I don &apos;t think we &apos;re that close .
And it &apos;s a number of projects .
You had for the first time mega-cities , &#91; of &#93; 5 million or more , which were occurring in the developing world .
In other words , we didn &apos;t have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .
And if you looked very closely , you &apos;d see that people were drawing with pencils , and they were pushing , you know , big rulers and triangles .
And I &apos;m just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project .
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder : schizophrenia . And as a sister and later , as a scientist , I wanted to understand , why is it that I can take my dreams , I can connect them to my reality , and I can make my dreams come true ?
I need them in the morning . &quot;
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I &apos;m walking around my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I gotta get to work . I gotta get to work .
And my spirit soared free , like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria .
What about one-on-one murder ? Well , there , there are good statistics , because many municipalities recorded the cause of death .
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead , and violence declines for selfish reasons . As Wright put it , &quot; Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini-van . &quot;
But with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; I am an expert .
So this is the problem . So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aware of them ?
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , rotated ?
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
Right in the middle of the picture !
You probably don &apos;t feel like you need a moment of thought .
Vegetably ? Minerally ? Animally ? He &apos;s pretty much covered them there .
Now we give you a choice : &quot; We happen to have some extra prints in the closet .
Right ? This is the change in liking score , the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked .
They say , &quot; I have to give one up ? &quot;
This is worth contemplating : &quot; The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another ...
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters .
We went to Africa , originally to look at the housing issue .
Well , my name is Sisi , because I work at the African center .
She &apos;s 70 years old . This is what FEMA gave her .
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
Just leave it up there for a sec .
